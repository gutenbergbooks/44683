<p class="small-title">WALTER BESANT'S LONDON BOOKS.</p>

<p class='center'><span class="smcap">Uniform Edition.</span> Demy 8vo. cloth, 5<i>s.</i> net each.</p>


<p class='center' style="font-size: x-large;">LONDON.</p>

<p class='center'>With 125 Illustrations.</p>

<blockquote><p>'What the late J. R. Green has done for England Sir Walter Besant has here attempted,
with conspicuous success, for Cockaigne. The Author of "A Short History of the English
People" and the historian of the London citizen share together the true secret of popularity.
Both have placed before the people of to-day a series of vivid and indelible pictures of the people
of the past.... No one who loves his London but will love it the better for reading this
book. He who loves it not has before him a clear duty and a manifest pleasure.'&mdash;<i>Graphic.</i></p>

<p>'Sir Walter Besant knows and loves his London thoroughly, and his beautifully illustrated
book will call up in the minds of those who bow to the spell a thousand delights of memory and
expectation. He contrives not merely to call back the old London, but to make the London of
the present more living than before.'&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p></blockquote>


<p class='center' style="font-size: x-large;">WESTMINSTER.</p>

<p class='center'>With 131 Illustrations.</p>

<blockquote><p>'Sir Walter Besant has told the story of the old city (London) and its corporate life in a way
which has never been surpassed&mdash;not even equalled. The past of the mother of municipal life he
has made to live and breathe in a manner which reduces all other records of London to the mere
dryasdust category. But we like his "Westminster" even better.... There is nothing
but admiration to be expressed as well for the plan as for the execution.'&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>'Sir Walter Besant has here given us a worthy companion to his charming book on "London."...
From beginning to end the narrative never flags, the illustrations never fail, and one
rises from its reading with fuller ideas of the historic interest of the place and a greater veneration
for the ancient Abbey and all its relics of the past.'&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p></blockquote>


<p class='center' style="font-size: x-large;">SOUTH LONDON.</p>

<p class='center'>With 120 Illustrations.</p>

<blockquote><p>'To all Londoners who realise the absorbing fascination of the great world they live in we
cordially recommend it as a worthy sequel to the author's previous volumes. It is written by an
enthusiast who is also an accomplished writer, by a student who is a close observer of life; and
it passes before the reader's imagination a series of indelible pictures which clothe our prosaic
and monotonous South London with the romance which is its due.'&mdash;<i>Literature.</i></p></blockquote>


<p class='center' style="font-size: x-large;">EAST LONDON.</p>

<p class='center'>With 55 Illustrations by <span class="smcap">Phil May</span>, <span class="smcap">Raven Hill</span>, and <span class="smcap">Joseph Pennell</span>.</p>

<blockquote><p>'Sir Walter Besant knows London as no one has known it since Charles Dickens.... He
has given a lifetime to the acquisition of his knowledge of the great city. He was grey before
he attempted to write his monumental works on "London," "Westminster," and "South
London"&mdash;books which have earned him his title as the historian of London&mdash;and he has postponed
his book on "East London" until his sixty-fifth year.... Crammed with antiquarian
lore mingled with human interest and saturated with genuine sympathy for the people is this
study of "East London."... A thoroughly masterly book.'&mdash;<i>Literary World.</i></p></blockquote>


<hr style="margin-left:37.5%; width: 25%;" />

<p class='center'>Crown 8vo. cloth, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>


<p class='center' style="font-size: x-large;">FIFTY YEARS AGO.</p>

<p class='center'>With 144 Plates and Woodcuts.</p>

<blockquote><p>'A series of entertaining chapters, to which the droll illustrations of George Cruikshank and
the inimitable portraits by Daniel Maclise lend additional effect.... The book is full of
movement and colour, and presents a vivid and interesting picture of the great reign of Queen
Victoria.'&mdash;<i>Speaker.</i></p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In sending forth this book on '<span class="smcap">South London</span>,' the successor
to my two preceding books on '<span class="smcap">London</span>' and '<span class="smcap">Westminster</span>,'
I have to explain in this case, as before, that it is not a
history, or a chronicle, or a consecutive account of the Borough
and her suburbs that I offer, but, as in the other two books,
chapters taken here and there from the mass of material which
lies ready to hand, and especially chapters which illustrate the
most important part of History, namely, the condition, the
manners, the customs of the people dwelling in this place, now,
like Westminster, a part of London: yet, until two or three
hundred years ago, an ancient marsh kept from the overflowing
tide by an Embankment, joined to the Dover road by a Causeway,
settled and inhabited by two or three Houses of
Religious: by half a dozen Palaces of Bishops, Abbots, and
great Lords: by a colony of fishermen living on the Embankment
from time immemorial, since the Embankment itself was
built: and by a street of Inns and shops.</p>

<p>I hope that '<span class="smcap">South London</span>' will be received with favour
equal to that bestowed upon its predecessors. The chief
difficulty in writing it has been that of selection from the
great treasures which have accumulated about this strange
spot. The contents of this volume do not form a tenth part
of what might be written on the same plan, and still without
including the History Proper of the Borough. I am like the
showman in the 'Cries of London'&mdash;I pull the strings, and
the children peep. Lo! Allectus goes forth to fight and die
on Clapham Common: William's men burn the fishermen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">{vi}</a></span>
cottages: little King Richard, that lovely boy, rides out, all in
white and gold, from his Palace at Kennington&mdash;saw one ever
so gallant a lad? The Bastard of Falconbridge bombards
the city: Sir John Fastolfe's man is pressed into Jack Cade's
army: the Minters make their last Sanctuary opposite St.
George's: the Debtors languish in the King's Bench. There
are many pictures in the box&mdash;but how many more there are
for which no room could be found!</p>

<p>I must acknowledge my obligations, first, to the Editor
of the <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>, where half of these chapters first
had the honour of appearing, for the wealth of illustration of
which he thought them worthy: and next to the artist, Mr.
Percy Wadham, who has so faithfully and so cunningly carried
out the task committed to him.</p>

<hr style='margin-left:17.5%; width:65%'/>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />
<br />
THE FIRST SETTLEMENTS</h2>


<p>I propose to call the series of chapters which are to follow
by the general name of 'South London.' Like their predecessors
on 'London' and 'Westminster,' they will not attempt,
or pretend, to present a continuous history of this region&mdash;or,
indeed, a history at all: they will endeavour to do for this
part of London what their predecessors have already attempted
for the Cities of London and Westminster: that is to
say, they will present such episodes and incidents, with such
characters, as may serve to illustrate the life of the place; the
manners and customs of the people; the characteristics of the
Borough and its outlying suburbs. So far as history means
the march of armies and the clash of armour, we shall here
find little history. So far, also, as history means the growth
of our liberties, the struggles by which they were won; the
apparent decay, or defeat, from time to time, of the spirit of
freedom, with its inevitable recovery: the reader and the
student may be referred to the pages of a Stubbs or a Freeman&mdash;not
to my humbler page. Great is the work, and worthy
to be held in the highest honour, of those who trace out the
irresistible march of national freedom: I cannot join their company;
I must be contented with the lowlier, yet somewhat useful,
task of showing how the people, my forefathers, lived, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
what they thought, and how they sang and feasted and made
love and grew old and died.</p>

<p>My South London extends from Battersea in the west to
Greenwich in the east, and from the river on the north to the
first rising ground on the south. This rising ground, a gentle
ascent, the beginning of the Surrey hills, can still be observed
on the high roads of the south&mdash;Clapham, Brixton, Camberwell.
It now occupies the place of what was formerly a low
cliff, from ten to thirty or forty feet high, overhanging the
broad level, and corresponding to those cliffs on the other side
of the river, which closed in on either side of Walbrook and
made the foundation of London possible. If we draw a
straight line from the mouth of the Wandle on the west to the
mouth of the Ravensbourne on the east, we shall, roughly
speaking, indicate the southern boundary of our district;
unless, as we may very well do, we include Greenwich as
well. The whole of this region constitutes the Great South
Marsh: there is no rising ground, or hillock, or encroaching
cliff over the whole of this flat expanse. Before the river was
embanked it was one unbroken marsh: for eight miles in
length by a varying breadth of about two or two and a half
miles, the tidal stream twice in the twenty-four hours submerged
this space. Here and there lay islets or eyots, created,
as the centuries crept on, by the gradual accumulation of
branches, roots, reeds and rubbish, till they rose a few inches
above high water; the spring-tide covered them&mdash;sometimes
swept them away&mdash;then others began to form. In later times,
after the work of embankment had been commenced, these
islets became permanent, and were afterwards known as
Battersea, Bermondsey, Rotherhithe, Lambhithe, Newington,
Kennington. Even then, for many a long year, they were but
little areas rising a foot or two above the level, covered with
sedge, reeds, and tufts of coarse grass, hardly distinguishable
from the rest of the ground around them. Before the construction
of the river wall, no trees stood upon this morass, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
flowers of the field flourished there, no thorns and bushes
grew, no cattle pastured there; the wild deer were afraid of
it: there were no creatures of the land upon it. On the south
side rose the cliff of clay and sand, continually falling and
continually receding before the encroaching tide; on the north
side ran the river; beyond the river the cliff stood up above
the water's edge, where the tiny stream, afterwards named
from the Wall, leaped bright and sparkling into the rolling
flood. No man could live upon that marsh: its breath after
sunset and in the night was pestilential.</p>

<span class="caption">View from Southwark Marsh in Prehistoric Times.</span>
</div>

<p>Many streams poured into this marsh, and at low tide
made their way across it into the Thames: at high tide their
beds were lost in the shallows. Among them&mdash;to use names
by which they were afterwards distinguished&mdash;were the
Wandle, the Falcon, the Effra, the Ravensbourne, and others
which have disappeared and left no name. And so for unnumbered
years the tide daily ebbed and flowed, and the
reeds bent beneath the breeze, and the clouds scudded overhead,
and the wild birds screamed, far away from the world of
men and women, long after men and women began to wander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
about this Island called Albion. No one took any thought
of this marsh, any more than they heeded the marshes all
along the lower reaches of the river; and these were surely
the most desolate, dreary stretches of water and mud anywhere
in the world. Those who wish to realise what manner of
country it was which stretched away on the north and south
of the Thames may perhaps get some comprehension of it if
they stand on the point at Bradwell in Essex, beside the
ruined Chapel of St. Peter-on-the-Wall, and look out at low
tide to east and north.</p>

<p>In a previous volume dealing with another part of the
country called London I showed to my own satisfaction,
and, I believe, that of my readers, that long before there
existed any London at all, except perhaps a village of a few
fishermen with their coracles, Westminster or Thorney was
a busy and crowded place of resort, through which the whole
trade of the country north of the Thames passed on its way to
Dover and the southern ports. This position, new as it was,
and opposed to the general and traditional teaching&mdash;opposed,
for instance, to the traditional belief of Dean Stanley&mdash;has
never been attacked, and may be considered, therefore, as
generally accepted. When or how the trade of Thorney began,
to what extent it developed, we need not here inquire. Indeed,
I know not that any fragments of fact or of tradition exist
which would enable us to inquire. The fact itself, as will be
immediately seen, is of the highest importance as regards the
beginning and early history of the Southern settlements.</p>

<p>The ancient way of trade, then, ran across the island called
afterwards by the Saxons Thorney, the Isle of Bramble, now
Westminster. All the trade of the north passed over that
little spot, on which arose a considerable town for the reception
of the caravans. After resting a night or so at Thorney,
the merchants went on their way. Those who travelled south,
making for Dover, crossed over the ford, where there was
afterwards a ferry. This ferry continued until the erection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
of Westminster Bridge in the last century: the name still
survives in Horseferry Road. After the passage of the ford,
the travellers found themselves face to face with a mile of
dangerous bog, marsh and swamp, through which they had
to plod and plough their way, sinking over their knees, up to
the middle, before they emerged upon the higher ground,
now called Clapham Rise. To the merchants driving their
long chains of slaves and heavily laden packhorses and mules
from the north, this was the worst bit of the whole journey.
Every day there were rivers to be forded, in which some of
their slaves might get drowned or might escape; there were
dark woods, in which they might be attacked by hostile tribes;
there were hills to climb; but nowhere, in the whole of their
journey, was there a piece of country more difficult than this
great swamp beyond the Ford of Thorney. They splashed
and floundered through it, over ankles, over knees, up to the
middle, up to the neck, in mud and muddy water. The packhorses
sank deep down with their loads; they took off the
loads and laid them on the shoulders of the slaves, who threw
them off into the mud, and let them stay there, while they
made a mad attempt to escape. Horse and mule; slave and
slave-load; iron, lead, and skins: the merchant paid heavy
tribute while he crossed the marshes and waded through the
shallows of the broad tidal river.</p>

<p>At some time or other, the idea occurred to an unknown
person of engineering genius in advance of his time, that it
might not be impossible to construct a causeway across this
marsh; and that such a causeway would be extremely useful
and convenient for those who used the Thorney Fords. Perhaps
the causeway was his own invention; perhaps the work
was the first causeway ever constructed in this country;
perhaps the inventor began on the smallest possible scale,
with a very narrow way across the marsh to the nearest dry
ground, which was, of course, somewhere beyond Kennington;
perhaps the work, colossal for the time, carried the merchants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
and their caravans across the whole extent of the marsh&mdash;five
miles and more&mdash;to the rising ground of Deptford or
Greenwich, the nearest point to Dover. The causeway was
not unlike those which now run across the Hackney Marshes;
that is to say, it was raised so high as to be above the highest
spring tide, about six feet above the level of the marsh. It
was constructed by driving piles into the mud at regular
intervals, forming a wall of timber within the piles, and filling
up the space with gravel and shingle, brought from Chelsea&mdash;'Isle
of Shingle'&mdash;or from the nearest high ground, where
is now Clapham Common. The breadth of the causeway,
I take it, was about ten or twelve feet. The construction
of the work rendered the passage across the marsh perfectly
easy, and greatly facilitated that part of the trade of
the island which lay in the midland and on the north.</p>

<p>When was this causeway, the first step in road-making,
constructed? Perhaps it was a Roman work. I think, however,
that it is older than the Roman occupation; and for
these reasons. When London was first visited by the Romans
it was already a flourishing city with a '<i>copia negotiatorum</i>;'
in other words, it had already succeeded in attracting the
greater part of the trade which formerly passed through
Thorney. Had the Romans built the causeway, they would
have constructed it along a line drawn from one of the two
old ferries to Deptford. The causeway, therefore, must have
existed when the Romans arrived upon the scene, together
with, as we shall see immediately, the second causeway connecting
the ferry with the first causeway. I dare say the
Romans strengthened the work: turned it from a gravelled
way, soft in bad weather, into one of their hard, firm Roman
roads; faced it with stone, and made it durable. If South
London were to be stripped of all its houses, the two causeways
would be found still, hard and firm, beneath the mass
of accumulated soil and rubbish, as the Romans left them.</p>

<p>If you draw a straight line from 'Stanegate,' close to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
end of Westminster Bridge, as far as the beginning of the
Old Kent Road, you will understand the lie of the causeway.
And this causeway, understand, was the very first interference
of the hand of man with the marshes south of the Thames.
It was a way across the marsh: not an embankment against
the river, but a way. It did not keep out the tide which
flowed in on the other side&mdash;the Battersea side: it was simply
a way across the marsh. For a long time&mdash;we cannot tell
how long&mdash;it remained the principal way of communication
for the trade of Britain between the north and the south,
the midland and the south, the eastern counties and the
south.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Causeway_across_Southwark_Marsh" id="Causeway_across_Southwark_Marsh"></a>
<img src="images/illus_021.jpg" width="500" height="419" alt="Causeway across Southwark Marsh." title="" />
<span class="caption">Causeway across Southwark Marsh.</span>
</div>

<p>Consider, next, the site of London, as it appeared to the
merchants crossing the causeway. They saw, in the centuries
of which no trace or memory remains, when they turned their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
eyes northward, first a level of mud, sprinkled with little
eyots of reed and coarse grass, then the broad river, and beyond
the river two streams, one fuller than the other, each in
its own valley&mdash;that of the Walbrook was 132 feet wide at
the present site of the Mansion House&mdash;falling into the river;
a low cliff ran along the north bank, leaving stretches of marsh,
as on the south, but, where these streams ran into the Thames,
approaching close to the river, and actually overhanging it.
On the river they saw numerous coracles, with fishermen
catching salmon and every kind of fish in their nets. No
river in the world was more plentifully stocked with fish;
overhead flew screaming innumerable birds&mdash;geese, ducks,
herne&mdash;which the trappers trapped, snared, shot with sling
and stone by the thousand. On those cliffs overhanging the
river, the travellers by the causeway saw the huts of the fisherfolk.
Then, perhaps, they remembered the plenty of the
markets of Thorney; the abundance of birds, the vast
quantities of fish offered on those stalls. Those who were
curious connected the coracles on the river and the birds that
flew up from the lowlands with these markets; they saw that
London&mdash;'the place or fort over the Lake'&mdash;was the settlement
which furnished Thorney with a good part of her supplies.
And this I verily believe to have been the real origin
and cause of London. It was first settled by the humble folk
who came here for the purpose of catching fish and trapping
birds for the market of Thorney. This is a suggestion only;
it will be set aside, most certainly, by those who are not
pleased with the upsetting of old theories. To those who
are able to realise the ancient condition of things and all it
means, the suggestion will be received, I am convinced, as
more than a theory: it will be regarded and accepted as a
discovery.</p>

<p>Let us put it in another way. Thorney was a place of
great resort, as I have shown in these pages already: every
day passed into Thorney, and out of Thorney, long processions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
or caravans of merchants with merchandise carried
by slaves&mdash;the most valuable part of their merchandise&mdash;and
by packhorses and mules; they waded through the northern
ford; they rested for a night in one of the inns of the place:
next day they waded through the southern ford, attained the
causeway, and went south. Or else it was the reverse way.
The place required a daily supply of food, and, as there were
many travellers, a great quantity of food. If you go down
the river from Thorney, you will find that the present site of
London, on the two hillocks rising out of the river, was the
first and only place where men could put up huts in which to
live while they caught fish and trapped wild birds for
Thorney. If, therefore, the Isle of Bramble was a flourishing
centre of trade long before London was a place of trade
at all, then the original London must have been a settlement of
fishermen and trappers who supplied the markets of Thorney.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="Fishers39_Huts_at_the_mouth_of_the_Fleet" id="Fishers39_Huts_at_the_mouth_of_the_Fleet"></a>

of the Fleet." title="" />
<span class="caption">Fishers&#39; Huts at the mouth of the Fleet.</span>
</div>

<p>In course of time&mdash;we are still in prehistoric times&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
site of London was discovered by seamen and merchant
adventurers exploring the rivers in their ships. It was found
cheaper and easier and safer to carry goods to and from
Thorney by way of sea than by land. To coast along from
Dover to the strait between Rum&mdash;the Isle of Thanet, and
the mainland&mdash;to pass through the strait and up the river,
was found easier and cheaper than to undertake the costly
and dangerous march from Dover to Thorney Ford. This
way, then, was by many undertaken; and so a certain part of
the trade along the old causeway was diverted.</p>

<p>The next step was the discovery of London as a port.
There was no port at Thorney: on the site of London were
the two natural ports of Walbrook and the mouth of the
Fleet; there was a high ground safer and more salubrious
than that of Thorney; ships began to anchor there, quays
were erected, goods were landed; the high road which we
call Oxford Street was constructed to connect London with
the highway of trade&mdash;afterwards Watling Street; and the
trade of London began.</p>

<p>Now, if you look once more at the map of the south as it
was, you will observe that London at its first commencement
had no communication with any part of the world except by
water. The first road opened was, as I have said, the connection
with Watling Street; what was the next? It was a
connection with the high road to Dover: that connection was
the road which we now call High Street, Borough. These
two roads were the first communication between London and
any other place; all the other roads, to the north and south
and west and east, came afterwards. It was necessary for
London to have an open and direct connection, by land as
well as by sea, with the then principal port of the country.
The High Street formed that open communication; it began
not far to the west of St Saviour's Church, opposite the
Roman Trajectus, the mediæval ferry, now St. Mary Overies
Dock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span></p>

<p>Observe, however, that we are as yet very far from
embanking the river, or draining the marsh, or making it
inhabitable. If you walk across Hackney Marsh by one of
its causeways any autumnal morning, especially after rain,
you will understand something of what Southwark looked
like. Two high causeways crossed the marsh, of which as
yet not a square foot had been drained or reclaimed; yet the
place was not so wild as it had been; the wild birds had been
partly driven away by the noise and crowd of London, and
by the concourse of ships sailing continually up and down.
There was as yet no bridge. The ferry crossed the river
backwards and forwards all day long. The causeways were
crowded with people; but as yet nothing on the lowlands.
Before the marshes could be drained the river had to be
embanked.</p>

<span class="caption">Barking Creek</span>
</div>

<p>No one knows when that was done. It was done, however.
At some time or other a high earthwork was raised along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
north and south banks of the river, enclosing the marshes,
converting them into pasture and arable land, and keeping
out the tides of Thames. It was a work of the most signal
benefit; it was also a colossal piece of work, measured by
hundreds of miles, for it was continued all round the islets
and coast of Essex. It was a work requiring constant repair,
though most of it has stood splendidly. The wall gave way,
however, at Barking in the time of Henry the Second; at
Wapping in the time of Elizabeth; at Dagenham early in the
last century: at each of these places the repair of the wall
was costly and difficult. The embankment left behind it a
low-lying ground, rich and fertile; orchards and woods began
to grow and to flourish upon it; yet it was still swampy in
parts, numerous ponds lay about on it, streams wound their way
confined in channels, and let out through the embankment at
low tide by culverts.</p>

<p>Whether the bridge came before the embankment I cannot
decide. Yet I think that the embankment came first; for the
existence of Southwark&mdash;that of any part of South London&mdash;depended
not on the bridge, but on the embankment and the
ferry. Given, however, the embankment; the two causeways;
the bridge; two ferries&mdash;one at St. Mary Overies and the
other lower down, opposite the Tower: given, also, direct
communication with Dover, with Thorney&mdash;thence with the
midlands and the north: there could not fail to arise a
settlement or town of some kind on the south of the
Thames.</p>

<p>Let us next consider the conditions under which the town
of Southwark began to exist and to continue for a great many
years.</p>

<p>(1) There was no wall or any means of defence, except
the marsh which surrounded it and prohibited the approach
of an army except along the causeway.</p>

<p>(2) The ground lay low on either side the causeway, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
south of the embankment. Although the tide no longer
ebbed and flowed among the reeds and islets of the marsh,
yet it was covered with small ponds, some of them stagnant,
others formed by the many streams which flowed towards the
culverts on the embankment, through which at low tide they
escaped into the Thames; until some kind of drainage was
attempted, the place caused agues and fevers for any who
slept in its white miasma. In other words, not an embankment
only, but drainage of some kind, had to be undertaken
before life was possible on the marsh.</p>

<p>(3) There were no quays, no shipping, no merchants, no
trade, on the south side. All merchandise coming up from
the south for export at the port of London, all merchandise
landed at the port for the south, had to be carried across the
bridge.</p>

<p>(4) The crowds of people connected with the trade of
London&mdash;the porters, carriers, drivers, grooms and stable-boys,
stevedores, lightermen, sailors foreign and native, the
<i>employés</i> of the merchants, their wives, women and children&mdash;all
these people lived in London itself; they had their taverns
and drinking shops; their sleeping places and eating places,
in London; all the people employed in providing food and
drink and sport, lived on the other side. South London had
to be a place without trade, without noise, without disturbance
of workmen, without broils among the sailors or fights among
foreigners.</p>

<p>(5) It stood on the south bank of a river swarming with
fish.</p>

<p>(6) The only parts on which houses could be built were
along the line of the causeways, or along the line of the embankment.</p>

<p>These were the conditions. We should expect, therefore,
to find the place thinly inhabited; and to find that the houses
were all built beside or along the raised ways. We should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
next expect to find along the causeways that the houses
belonged to the wealthier class.</p>

<p>We should expect, further, to find no sailors' or working
men's quarters. The former because there were no ships; the
latter because there were no markets. Lastly, we should not
be surprised to find the place very early occupied by inns and
places of accommodation for those who resorted to London.</p>

<p>All this was, in fact, what did take place. The Roman
remains are numerous; they are all found along the causeways;
the existence of a Roman cemetery shows that it was
a place of some importance. I say <i>some</i>, because its very
limited extent proves that it was never a large place. I will
return immediately to the Roman remains.</p>

<p>There was, however, one trade, one class of working men
which took up its abode along the embankment of Southwark:
it was that of the fishermen, driven across the river by the
growth of London. There was no room for the fishermen
with their coracles and nets along the line of quays on the
north side; they wanted a place to haul up their boats, and a
place to spread their nets,&mdash;they could not find either in the
north; nor would the fish be caught in waters troubled perpetually
by oars and keels. The fisherfolk, therefore, put up
their huts along the embankment; for long centuries afterwards
the fisherfolk continued to live in South London. The
last remnant of Thames fishermen occupied, well into the
present century, a single court in Lambeth; it is described as
unpaved, unglazed, unlighted, dirty, and insanitary. But the
last salmon had been caught in the river; the Thames fishermen
were by that time almost starved out of existence. I am
sure that the south was always their place of residence; the
foreshore offered them what they could not find on the north
bank. To him, however, who considers the fisheries of the
Thames, there are many points on which, for want of exact
information, he may speculate and theorise as much as he
pleases. For instance, later on, there were fishermen living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
at Limehouse. Some of the Thames watermen lived here
also&mdash;the legend of Awdry the ferryman assigns to him a
residence on the south; their favourite place of residence,
however, was St. Katherine's first, and Wapping afterwards.</p>

<span class="caption">RELICS OF THE STONE AGE</span>
</div>

<p>The Roman remains found up and down the place prove
my assertion that the people who lived here were what we
should call substantial. One need not catalogue the long list
of Roman <i>trouvailles</i>; but, to take the more important, in the
year 1819 there was discovered, in taking up the foundations
of some old houses belonging to St. Thomas's Hospital, in St.
Thomas's Street, a fine tesselated pavement, about ten feet
below the surface of the ground. In the following year, in
the area facing St. Saviour's Grammar School, seven or eight
feet below the surface, there was found another, of a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
elaborate design. Only a part of this was uncovered, as the
Governors of the School forbade further investigation: it
remains to this day still to be examined and unearthed, under
the present potato and fruit market. At the entrance of
King Street, at a depth of fifteen or sixteen feet, were found
a great many Roman lamps, a vase, and other sepulchral
deposits. And in tunnelling for a new sewer through Blackman
Street and Snow Fields, in 1818 and 1819, and again in
Union Street, in 1823, numerous Roman antiquities were discovered.
In Trinity Square was found a coin of Gordianus
Africanus. In Deverill Street, south of the Dover road, other
coins were discovered; in St. Saviour's churchyard, a coin of
Antoninus Pius. It has also been proved that an extensive
Roman cemetery existed on the south of the ancient settlement.
In the year 1840, when excavations were going on for
the purpose of building a new wing to St. Thomas's Hospital,
another tesselated pavement was disclosed, with passages and
walls of other chambers, all built on piles, showing that the
houses beside the causeway were thus supported in the marshy
ground; Roman coins and pottery were also found here.
Another pavement was discovered on the opposite side, south
of Winchester Palace. On the river bank, at the corner of
Clink Street, an ancient jetty was found; and in the new
Southwark Street, deep down, groups of piles, pointed below, on
which houses had been built. In many of the later buildings
Roman tiles have been found. These remains are quite sufficient
to prove that many wealthy people lived in Roman
Southwark, and that they occupied villas built on piles beside
the causeway.</p>

<p>Since, too, from the earliest times Southwark was famous
for its inns, and since the same conditions prevailed in the
fourth as in the fourteenth century, it is not unreasonable to
suppose that the people who drove those long lines of packhorses
laden with goods from London used Southwark as a
place in which to deposit merchandise before taking it across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
the bridge; they halted in Southwark; they lodged in one of
the inns: the place was most convenient for the City; storage
was cheaper than on the river wharves; for strangers, the
place was cheerful. In one respect, that of being a halting
place and a lodging for traders, Southwark was like Thorney
in its palmy days&mdash;a place of entertainment for man and
beast. There was no forum here, as in Augusta; no place of
meeting for merchants, such as Thames Street in Plantagenet
times; there was no buying and selling, but there was continual
coming and going, which made the place lively and
cheerful.</p>

<p>Such were the origins of the settlements of South London.
An embankment, a causeway, a fishery for the wants of
Thorney first and of London
next; then villas, put
up by the better sort, attracted
here, one believes,
by the fresh air coming up
the river with every tide,
and by the quiet of the place.
The settlement began quite
early in the Roman occupation:
this seems to be proved by the extent of the cemetery.
The draining and drying of the low lands went on meanwhile
gradually, gardens and orchards taking the place of the
former marsh.</p>

<span class="caption">A RELIC OF THE STONE AGE</span>
</div>

<p>The place has always, save at rare intervals, been entirely
defenceless. The <i>Pax Romana</i> protected it. Remember
that London itself was not walled till the latter part of the
fourth century. Why should it be? For more than three
hundred years, for ten generations, the City knew no wars
and feared no invader. The 'Count of the Saxon Shore'
beat back, and kept back, the pirates of Norway and Denmark;
the Legions beat back the marauders of Scotland and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
Ireland. Southwark, like the City its neighbour, needed no
wall and asked for no defence.</p>

<p>Twice, before the arrival of the East Saxons, we get a
glimpse in history of South London. The first is the rout of
the usurper, the Emperor Allectus, after the battle of Clapham
Common.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the third century the succession of
usurpers who sprang up everywhere in the outlying portions
of the Empire contained six who came from Britain. What
effect these movements had upon the security of South London
we have no means of learning. The history, however, of
Carausius and his successor Allectus affords material for reflection.
The former, who was of Belgian origin, rose to be
the Count of the Saxon Shore&mdash;in other words, Admiral of
the Roman Fleet. In this capacity he kept the seas free
from pirates; enriched himself, became famous for his courage
and his generosity; usurped the title of Cæsar, fought with
and defeated the fleets of Maximian, and reigned in Britain
for seven years. His headquarters were Boulogne and Southampton;
near the latter place&mdash;at Bittern&mdash;is still seen the
quay at which his ships were moored. His rule, of which we
know little, was certainly strong and firm. Coins exist in
great numbers of Carausius. They represent his arrival:
'Expectate, veni'&mdash;'Come, thou long-expected!' Then his
triumph: 'Shout IO ten times.' He held gladiatorial sports
at London; he appointed a British senate. Then came the
time when he must fight or die. Like the King of the Grove,
the Usurper held his throne on that condition. Carausius, for
some unknown reason, would not fight when the chance was
offered&mdash;therefore he died. Another King of the Grove,
Allectus by name, one of his officers, killed him and reigned
in his stead. Then he, too, had to fight for crown and life.
He accepted the challenge; he awaited with an army of
Franks and Britons the arrival of the Roman forces sent to
quell him: he awaited them in London. When the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
drew near, he led out his men across the Bridge, and gave
battle to the Roman general, Asclepiodotus, on the wild heath
south of London, immediately beyond the rising ground&mdash;we
now call the place Clapham Common&mdash;and there he fell bravely
fighting. He had enjoyed the purple for three years. Perhaps,
when he crossed the Bridge, conscious that he was going
to meet his fate&mdash;either to continue an Emperor for another
spell or to die&mdash;he reflected that for such a splendid three
years' run it was worth while to risk, and even to lose, his life
at the end.</p>

<span class="caption">RELICS OF THE BRONZE AGE</span>
</div>

<p>This is, I say, the first glimpse we get of South London
in history. We see the army marching across the Bridge
and along the Causeway, shouting and singing. We see
them a few hours later, flying from the field, rushing headlong
over the Causeway, through the lines of villas to the
Bridge. The terrified people, those who lived in the villas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
are running over the Bridge after them. Once across the
Bridge, the soldiers found that there was left in the City
neither order nor authority. They therefore began to sack
and pillage the rich houses, and to murder the inhabitants.
Remember that all over the Roman Empire none were
permitted to carry arms except the soldiers. Therefore
there could be no defence. The pillage went on until the
victorious general had got his army&mdash;or some of it&mdash;across
the Bridge. How long it would take to bring up his troops,
whether the Bridge was held by the Franks, whether the
defeated army made any organised opposition, we know not.
All we are told is that the Roman soldiers fought hand to
hand with those of the dead Usurper in the streets of London,
and that the latter were all massacred.</p>

<p>In the year 457 we get a second glimpse of Southwark in
the flight of another defeated host. The Britons had gone
forth to fight the Saxon invaders; they met the enemy&mdash;Hengist
and Æsc his son&mdash;at 'Creeganford'&mdash;Crayford:
they were defeated; four thousand of them were killed; they
fled; they never stopped until they reached London Bridge;
we can see them flying bareheaded, without weapons, along
the Causeway and through the narrow gates of the Bridge.
Alas! the old villas along the Causeway are deserted and in
ruins; the place has been desolate for many years&mdash;since the
Saxons began to swarm about the country; the former
residents, if they are living still, are behind the walls; and
their sons are carrying on the war which is to last two
hundred long years, and to leave its memories of hatred
behind it for fifteen hundred years at least. The gardens are
grown over, the orchards are neglected, the inns are empty
and ruinous.</p>

<p>Before long there falls the silence of death upon the
walled City and the Bridge and the settlements of the South.
All alike are deserted: the tide idly laps the piles of the
rotting Bridge; it rolls along the empty wharves, bearing no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
keel upon its bosom; there is no boat on the river, there is
no smoke from any house; there is no life, no sign of life, in
the place which had formerly been so crowded and so busy.
The timbered face of the embankment gave way and
crumbled into the river; the Causeway was eaten by the tides
here and there; the low grounds once more became a marsh,
and the wild birds returned, undisturbed, to their former haunts.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere ('London,' ch. i.) described the natural
reasons which led to this desertion of the City. It appears
to us strange and almost impossible that a great city should
be so utterly deserted. Where, however, are the cities of
Tadmor, of Tyre, of Carthage? Where are the great cities
of Asia Minor? The conqueror not only took the City and
killed some of the people; he cut off the supplies, and therefore
forced them to go. This was most certainly the case
with London. Roger of Wendover, it is true, tells us that in
the year 462 the Saxons took possession of London, and then
successively of York, Lincoln, and Winchester, committing
great devastation. 'They fell on the natives in every quarter,
like wolves on sheep forsaken by their shepherds; the
churches and all the ecclesiastical buildings they levelled with
the ground; the priests they slew at the altars; the holy
scriptures they burned with fire; the tombs of the holy
martyrs they covered with mounds of earth; the clergy who
escaped the slaughter fled with the relics of the saints to the
caves and recesses of the earth, to the woods and deserts and
the crags of the mountains.'</p>

<p>I do not suppose that Roger of Wendover (he died in
1237) had access to documents of the time. I would rather
incline to the belief that, given certain undoubted facts of
battle, murder, and sacrilege, he presented the world with a
little embroidery of his own. An Assault on London is,
however, possible; in which case the desertion of the City
would be only hastened. With the ruin and desolation of
Augusta came also the ruin of the southern settlement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span></p>

<p>This silence&mdash;this desolation&mdash;lasted some hundred years.
Then the men of Essex&mdash;the East Saxons&mdash;came down, a few
at a time, and took possession of the deserted City; the
merchants began timidly to bring their ships again with goods
for trade; the East Saxons learned the meaning of bargains;
Augusta was dead, but London revived. The City preserved
its ancient name, but the southern settlement lost its name.
We know not what the Romans or the Britons called it, but
the Saxons called it Southwark. And they repaired the
embankment and restored the ancient causeways, and cleared
away the ruins.</p>

<p>Another point of difference: in London the new streets,
laid out without rule or order, grew by degrees; they did not
follow the old Roman streets, which were quite obliterated
and utterly forgotten&mdash;one cannot imagine a more decisive
proof of complete desertion and ruin. In Southwark, on the
other hand, the streets remained the same&mdash;they were the
two causeways and the embankment&mdash;because none others
were then possible. High Street, Borough, is still, as it
always has been, the ancient causeway connecting the new
port of London with the Dover road.</p>

<p>Between the years 600 and 1000 Southwark suffered the
vicissitudes which must happen in a period of continual
warfare to an undefended suburb. In times of peace, when
trade was possible, the place was what the Icelander Snorro
Thirlesen calls an 'emporium.' All the merchandise carried
to London from the south for export lay there waiting to be
carried across the quays: the merchants themselves found
accommodation there. But we cannot believe that when the
Danish fleets brought their fierce warriors to the very walls of
London, Southwark&mdash;or any other settlement&mdash;would continue
to exist unfortified. That the place remained without
a wall, except for certain temporary walls put up by the
Danes, proves that it was regarded by itself as of small
importance. This is also proved by another fact&mdash;namely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
that the place was always occupied without defence. When,
for instance, the Danes held London for twelve years, leaving
it a wreck and a ruin, can we believe that any people remained
in Southwark? In times of peace the fishermen lived
here for greater convenience of their work; London by this
time was impossible for them, because it was walled all along
the river side. If peace was prolonged, inns were set up for
the merchants: people built houses along the causeway.
When war began again, and the enemy once more appeared,
Southwark was again abandoned. This is the history of
South London for a thousand years&mdash;alternate occupation
and abandonment.</p>

<p>There exists a very singular heresy concerning Southwark.
I would deal with it tenderly, because one, if not more, of
the heretics is a personal friend of my own. It is that the
site of the first or original London was on the South; that
Roman London stood on the site of Southwark; and that, at
some time or other, there was a transference of sites, the
whole of Roman London migrating to the other side. It is
even maintained that the name of Walworth proves that
there was once a wall round the city of the south. To me
the name of Walworth indicates the proximity of the high
causeway running through its midst. The consideration of
the site&mdash;the marshy, wet, and unwholesome site&mdash;is quite
sufficient for me. At no time, not even in the time of the
Lake dwellers, have marshes been selected by choice for the
building of cities. Before the Embankment and the Causeway,
the South of London was impossible for the residence
of man.</p>

<p>The transference of sites is a theory often called in to
account for, and make possible, other theories. Thus, the
late James Fergusson invented the transference of sites in
order to bolster up certain theories of his own on the Holy
Places of Jerusalem. Here, however, there is no theory:
only a statement by a geographer evidently ignorant of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
boundaries of an obscure province of a district in a distant
country which he had never seen. London, Ptolemy said,
was in Kent. All the Roman remains, as we have seen, are
found by the Causeway and the Embankment&mdash;there never
could have been any wall; and, indeed, the only answer that
is required to such a theory is to point to the natural
conditions of the site. Is it conceivable that people would
settle themselves in a marsh when they had firm and dry
ground across the river?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span></p>



<hr style='margin-left:17.5%; width:65%'/>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II
<br />
<br />
EARLY HISTORY</h2>


<p>Southwark, then, had no reason for existence at all except
for its connection with London by bridge and ferry, and
especially by bridge. Before the Ferry and the Bridge there
was no Southwark. The history of Southwark is closely
connected with the Bridge. It was on the south end of the
Bridge that all the fighting took place, London very generously
handing over her battles to her daughter of the south.
I propose, in this chapter, to discourse about the Bridge and
one or two of its earlier battles.</p>

<p>It is sometimes stated, confidently, that before the Bridge
there was the Ferry. Why? To carry people across the
river and 'dump' them down in the marsh? But people had
no business in the marsh. First came the Bridge and the
Causeway to connect it with the Dover road. Then traffic
began to cross the Bridge and to meet the Dover road. But
as yet there was no ferry. Then came the Embankment, and
the appearance of houses along the Causeway and on the
Embankment. As the trade of London increased, so Southwark&mdash;I
would we had the Roman name&mdash;increased in proportion.
Inns were created for the convenience of merchants,
trade was drawn from Thorney on the south by the Bridge,
just as it was diverted on the north by the military way
connecting the great high road with London. When the
Causeway was always filled with caravans and long trains of
heavily laden packhorses; when the inns were crowded with
merchants and their slaves; when the Bridge was all day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
covered with passengers and carriers; then the Ferry was
demanded as a quicker and an easier way of getting across.
Two Ferries, there were; perhaps more. One of these ran
from Dowgate Dock to St. Mary Overies; the other crossed
the river lower down, nearer the Tower. So things remained
for nearly two thousand years&mdash;say, from <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 100 to <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
1750. If a man wanted to get across the river, he did not
make his way to London Bridge, and painfully walk across
amid the carriers and the caravans, the plunging horses and
the droves of oxen; he stepped into the boat and was ferried
across. We must not look on the Bridge as a means of getting
across the river for the people: it was not; it was the means
of conveying merchandise to and fro; it was a construction
most important for military purposes; it was a barrier to
prevent a hostile fleet from getting higher up the river; but,
for the ordinary passenger, the boat was the quicker and the
easier means of conveyance.</p>

<p>When was the Bridge built? It is impossible to say. It
was not there <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 61, when Queen Boadicea's troops sacked
the City and murdered the people. It was there when Allectus
led his troops out to fight the Roman legions. It was there
very early in the Roman occupation, as is proved by the
quantities of Roman coins of the four centuries of their tenure
found in the bed of the river on the site of the old Bridge. It
is also proved by the fact that Southwark was a settlement of
the wealthier class, who could not have lived in a place absolutely
without supplies, had there been no bridge. We may
take any time we please for the construction of the Bridge,
so long as it is quite early&mdash;say, before the second century.</p>

<p>The building of the Bridge can be arrived at with such
great certainty that I have no hesitation in presenting a
drawing of it. As this Bridge has never before been figured
by the pencil of any artist, it will be well for me to indicate
the steps by which its reconstruction has been made possible.</p>

<img src="images/illus_041.jpg" width="550" height="382" alt="Merchants crossing Southwark Marsh" title="" />
<span class="caption">Merchants crossing Southwark Marsh</span>
</div>

<p>The Britons themselves were quite unable to construct a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
bridge of any kind, unless in the primitive methods observed
at Post Bridge and Two Bridges, on Dartmoor, by a slab of
stone laid across two boulders. The work, therefore, was
certainly undertaken by Roman engineers. We have, in the
next place, to inquire what kind of bridge was built at that
time by the Romans. They built bridges of wood and of
stone; many of these stone bridges still remain, in other cases
the pieces of hewn stone still remain. The Bridge over
the Thames, however, was of wood. This is proved by the
fact that, had it been of the solid Roman construction in
stone, the piers would be still remaining; also by the fact that
London had to be contented with a wooden bridge till the
year 1176, when the first bridge of stone was commenced.
Considerations as to the comparative insignificance of London
in the first century, as to the absence of stone in the neighbourhood,
and as to the plentiful supply of the best wood in
the world from the forests north of the City, confirm the
theory that the Bridge was built of wood. We have only,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
therefore, to learn how Roman engineers built bridges of wood
elsewhere, in order to know how they built a bridge of wood
over the Thames. And this we know without any doubt.</p>

<p>First: they drove piles into the bed of the river&mdash;not upright
piles, but inclined at an angle; they placed two piles
side by side, and opposite to these two more; they connected
the two piles by ties and the opposite piles with them by
transverse girders. Across them they laid a huge beam&mdash;a
tree roughly hewn, and across these beams they laid the floor
of stout planks. The weight of beams and planks and the
parapet put up afterwards, with perhaps other planks for
greater safety, pressed down the piles and held them in place.
To prevent the current from carrying them away, each double
pair of piles was protected by a 'starling,' formed by driving
upright smaller piles in front at the piers and enclosing a
space, which was filled up with stones, so that the force of the
current was not felt by the great piles.</p>

<p>In this way the Roman Bridge was built. You will
understand it better from the drawing, which shows the Bridge
taken from the Embankment near the present site of St. Mary
Overies Church. The gate is the river-gate in the long
straight wall which ran along the bank of the river. The
wall, it is obvious, must have been pierced at several points
for the convenience of trade and the quays: one supposes
that these posterns could be easily closed and defended.
This river-wall, we shall presently see, was standing in the
time of Cnut. Some parts of it stood until the building of
the stone Bridge in the last quarter of the twelfth century.
The Roman Bridge was also the Saxon Bridge, the Danish
Bridge, and the Norman Bridge.</p>

<p>In course of time the river-wall was removed, bit by bit:
its foundations still lie under the pavement and the warehouses.
The gate was altered. I do not suppose there was much
of the original structure left when the East Saxons took
possession of the City after a hundred years of desertion and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
decay. But a gate of some kind there must always have
been. The breadth of the Bridge allowed, according to FitzStephen,
two carts to pass each other. That means about
sixteen feet. Like the very ancient stone bridges of Saintes
and Avignon, the Bridge was from sixteen to twenty feet
broad. The river-gate stood at the south end of Botolph
Lane, some seventy feet east of the present Bridge: the
second Bridge&mdash;the first of stone&mdash;stood between the first
and third, having St. Magnus' Church on the north and St.
Olave's on the south side; together with its own chapel of
St. Thomas on the Bridge itself, to place it under the special
protection of the saints most dear to London hearts.</p>

<span class="caption">London Bridge, A.D. 1000</span>
</div>

<p>The Bridge, and especially the south end of it, was a field
of battle whenever the way of war came near to London. The
first glimpse, as we have seen, which we catch of it is when
Allectus and his forces crossed the river by the Bridge to give
battle to the legions of Asclepiodotus on the Heath beyond
the rising ground. A few hours later, on the same day, their
columns routed, their general dead, we see the defeated troops
once more flying across the narrow Bridge. There was no
one to lead them, or they could have held the Bridge against
all comers; there was no drawbridge to pull up, or they could
have kept the Romans out by that expedient. One wonders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
if all their officers were lying dead on the field, with Allectus,
for the troops, who were Franks for the most part, seem to
have left the Bridge without a guard, and the river-gate
wide open, while they melted into little companies, who ran
about the City pillaging the houses and murdering the unfortunate
people.</p>

<p>By the Roman law the people were unarmed: no one
could carry arms except the soldiers. The law was a safeguard
against rebellion; but it opened the door to military
revolts, and it destroyed the military spirit among the civil
population&mdash;always a most dangerous thing for a State. The
Roman legions poured into the City; they found Allectus'
Franks at their murderous work, and they cut them down. If
it is true, as stated by the historians, that they were all cut off
to a man, London must have been a horrible shambles.</p>

<p>The second glimpse of the Bridge is also that of a routed
army flying across the narrow way to seek shelter between the
walls. It is in the year 467. They are the Britons flying
from their defeat in Kent. After this there is silence&mdash;absolute
silence, leaving not so much as a whisper, a tradition, or a
legend; the silence that can only mean desertion&mdash;silence for
a hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p>When London reappears, it is in humble guise: the City
has shrunk within her ancient walls; and these have fallen
into decay. Southwark no longer exists. We learn that the
Bridge has been repaired, because there is easy communication
with Canterbury. Yet in the Danish troubles there is no
fighting on or for the Bridge. Why? simply because there
were no defenders of the Bridge on the south. In 819 and
in 857 the Danes entered London and 'slaughtered numbers,'
apparently without opposition. In 872 they occupied London,
apparently without opposition. We hear of no siege, of no
fighting on the Bridge; of no shelter behind the walls. Yet
there was a defence at York, at Reading, at Nottingham&mdash;behind
the walls. Why not in London? Because in London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
the walls, 5,500 yards in length, had become too long to man,
or to defend, or to repair. The Danes ran into the City
through the shattered gate; they leaped over the broken wall.
What happened to the people; what street fighting was
carried on, what slaughter, what plunder, what horrible treatment
of women&mdash;we may understand from the page of the
historian Saxo relating other sacks and sieges by the gentle
Dane. As for the trade, the wealth, the name and fame of
London&mdash;they all perished together. It was a ruined city,
with a miserable population of craftsmen enslaved by the
Dane, that Alfred reconquered. The Bridge itself was broken
down; the settlements of the south were deserted: even the
fishermen had left the Thames above and below London, and
sought for safety in the retired creeks and safe backwaters
along the coast of Essex. The London fisherman sallied
forth in his coracle from the marshes behind Canvey Island,
and from the slopes of Hadleigh. Alfred repaired the walls
and the Bridge and rebuilt the gates. Something like peace
was restored to the City and order to the country. Then
trade, which welcomes the first appearance of safety, began
again. If the merchant feared the pirates of the Foreland, he
could march across the Bridge to Dover; or he could land at
Dover and march across Kent to the Bridge. Then the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
settlements on the south Causeway were rebuilt and new inns
sprang up, and Southwark began again.</p>

<p>A hundred years of rest from the 'army,' as the 'Chronicle'
calls the Danes, gave Southwark time to grow. It is spoken
of by the Danish historian as an 'emporium.' I understand
from the use of this word that the trade of London was
carried on principally by way of Dover, because the seas were
swarming with pirates. Southwark was a halting-place and a
resting-place, such as Thorney had been of old.</p>

<p>The prosperity of the settlement, however, received
another blow when the Danes once more, mindful of their
former victories, sailed up the river with hope of again taking
London. Southwark was defenceless. There was never any
wall about the place: its population was migratory. When
the enemy appeared the people of Southwark retreated across
the Bridge. The Danes landed, pillaged, and burned; they
then went away. Some of the people returned, especially the
fishermen, whose huts were easily repaired. When, however,
the attacks became more frequent, and the Danes appeared
every year, Southwark was deserted. But in London itself
they were grievously disappointed; for their grandfathers
had told them that it was a feeble and a helpless place,
perfectly incapable of resistance, with walls through whose
wide gaps a whole army could march; and they fondly
expected to find it in the same condition. But it had been
growing, unseen by them, in population and resource and
power.</p>

<p>In the year 992 the City showed its strength in a manner
which was extremely startling to the Danes; for it equipped
a great fleet, manned the ships with stout-hearted citizens,
sent the ships down the river, met the Danish fleet, engaged
them, and routed them with great slaughter. Two years
later they returned, eager for revenge&mdash;the revenge which
they vainly sought in six successive sieges. The army on
this occasion consisted of Norsemen and Danes in alliance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
under the two kings, Olaf of Norway and Swegen of Denmark.
They were firmly resolved to take the City: with their
warriors they would attack it by land, with their ships by
water. They had no ladders; they had no knowledge of
mining; they had no battering-rams; they could, and doubtless
did, endeavour to break down the gates with trunks of
trees; but the gates were well manned and well defended. On
the river-side one half of the town kept open their communications;
the other half were exposed to the arrows of the
sailors, but had arrows of their own. How long the siege
lasted I know not; the 'Chronicle,' all too brief, tells us only
that the enemy discovered that they could not prevail, and
that they withdrew.</p>

<span class="caption">SHIPS, BAYEUX TAPESTRY</span>
</div>

<p>The appearance of a Danish or Norwegian fleet, whose
ships were models to King Alfred when he founded the
English Navy, must not be gathered from the drawings of
the Bayeux tapestry, where the ships are conventional in
treatment. We have, fortunately, one actual surviving specimen
of a ship of King Olaf's time. It is the famous ship
of Gokstad, in Norway. Look at the two pictures on this
and following page. One is taken from the tapestry, the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
is the Gokstad vessel. The former carries about a dozen men,
rather high out of the water, with straight sides, and would
certainly capsize. The latter is a long, light, swift vessel,
built for speed, and able to sail over quite shallow water; she
is constructed on lines which, for beauty or for usefulness,
cannot be surpassed even at the present day: she rides
lightly, drawing very little water. She is clinker built; the
planks overlying each other are fastened with iron bolts,
riveted and clinched on the inside. She is built of oak; her
length from stem to stern, over all, is 78 feet; her keel is
66 feet; her breadth is 16½ feet; her depth is no more than
4 feet; the third plank from the top is twice as thick as the
others; she is pierced by portholes for as many oars. The
ship is pointed at both ends; she is steered by a rudder
attached to the side of the stern; on each side hang 16 shields;
she carried 64 rowers, and probably as many men besides. The
decorations lavished on the ship were profuse. The figure-head
was gilt, the stern was gilt, the shields were gilt; the ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
were painted in long lines of bright colour&mdash;you can see that in
the ships of the Bayeux tapestry. The whole of the vessel&mdash;bows,
figure-head, gunwale, stern-post&mdash;were covered with
carvings; the sails were decorated with embroideries; the
mast was gilt. Verily the 'fleet shone as if it were on fire.'</p>

<span class="caption">A Viking Ship</span>
</div>

<p>Such were the ships which came up, nearly a hundred in
company, with Olaf and Swegen. Low in the water they
came, the oars sweeping in a long, measured swish of the
water: swiftly flying up the broad river, the sunshine lighting
up the colours and the gilding of the ships, and the bright
arms of the company on board. It was a company of tall
and strong men; young, every one, with long fair hair and
blue eyes. From the grey walls of the town, from the Bridge
on the river, the citizens saw the splendid array rushing up to
destroy them if they could. At the Bridge, the foremost
stop: they go no farther; those behind cry 'Forward!' and
those in front cry 'Back!' The Bridge would suffer none to
pass; and so, jammed together, perhaps lashed together, as
when Olaf was to meet his death five years later in his last
splendid sea-fight, they essayed to take the city by assault.
They shot arrows with red-hot heads over the walls, to strike
and set light to the thatch; they shot arrows at the citizens
on the walls; they tried to scale the piles of the Bridge. If
they could get within the City, these splendid savages, there
would be slaughter and pillage, ravishing of women, firing of
the thatch, the roar of flames and the clashing of weapons,
and next day silence, long teams of slaves and of treasure
lifted into the ships, bows turned outward; and the fleet
would leave behind it a London once more desolate and naked
and forlorn, as when the East Saxon entered towards the end
of the sixth century. It was a day of fate, and big with destiny.
Had the Danes succeeded, we know not what might have been
the history of London and of England.</p>

<p>When they were beaten off, the people of Southwark went
back to their homes, and the daily business of life was carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
on as usual. We may observe that if there had been a
permanent settlement here&mdash;a town of any importance&mdash;they
would have built a wall to protect it. But there was never
any wall; the place could be approached by the Causeway or
by the river; no one ever at any time thought of protecting
Southwark.</p>

<p>But now a worse time fell upon the place, as well as upon
London. The whole country, almost unresisting, was ravaged
by the Danes: Swegen came over and proved the English
weakness, and saw that time would help him, if he waited.
Time did help him, and famine helped him as well.</p>

<p>In 1009 occurred the second siege of London, this time by
Thurkitel, who afterwards entered into the service of Ethelred.
He ravaged Kent and Essex, took up his winter quarters on
the Thames, apparently at Greenwich, and laid siege to the
City&mdash;but in vain. It is of course obvious that without
ladders, mines, battering-rams, or wooden towers, the City
could never be taken. The people beat him off at every
assault with great loss. It seems as if the whole valour in
England was at the moment concentrated in London.</p>

<p>The third siege of London was in 1013, when Swegen
returned. This time, mindful of his former failure, and of
Thurkitel's failure, he left his ships at Southampton; he
marched upon London by way of Winchester, which he took on
the way; but although he came up from the south, he did not
attack from the south, nor did he encamp on the south. The
reason is obvious: the Causeway was narrow; to fight on the
Bridge was to engage a mere handful of men; there was no place
except that and the Causeway. Swegen, therefore, passed over
the ford of Westminster, and attacked the walls on the north side.
Within the City was Thurkitel, now in the English service;
by his help or counsel, the Londoners drove Swegen off the
field. He withdrew. But all England rapidly submitted to
his arms; therefore London, too, seeing that it was useless to
hold out alone, sent hostages and submitted. It is reported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
that they were terrified at the threats of Swegen: he would
cut off their hands and their feet; he would tear out their eyes;
he would burn and destroy&mdash;and so forth. But these promises
were the common garnish of besiegers; they no more
frightened the defenders of London at this time than they
frightened the defenders of any other city.</p>

<p>The end of Swegen, as everybody knows, was that
St. Edmund of Bury killed him for doubting his saintliness.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="SKETCH_MAP" id="SKETCH_MAP"></a>

<span class="caption">SKETCH MAP</span>
</div>

<p>We now come to the three successive sieges by King Cnut.
The expedition with which he proposed to reduce London
was far finer and more powerful than that of Olaf and Swegen.
The poetic description of it says that the ships were counted by
hundreds; that they were manned by an army among whom
there was never a slave, or a freeman son of a slave, or one
unworthy man, or an old man. Freeman asks what nobility
meant if all were nobles? A strange question for one so
learned! The nobles of Denmark were simply the conquering
race; nobility consisted in free birth, and in descent from
the conquering race, not the conquered: it was not necessarily
a small caste; it might possibly include the larger part of the
people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span></p>

<p>Cnut anchored off Greenwich and prepared for his siege.
First of all, he resolved that the Bridge should no longer bar
the way. He therefore cut a trench round the south of the
Bridge, by means of which he drew some of his ships to the
other side of it. He then cut another trench round the whole
of the wall. In this way he hoped to shut in the City and cut
off all supplies: if he could not take the place by storm, he
would starve it out. There are no details of the siege, but as
Cnut speedily abandoned the hope of success and marched off
to look after Edmund, his investment of the City was certainly
not a success.</p>

<p>He met Edmund and fought two battles with him; with
what result history has made us acquainted. He then returned
and resumed the siege of London. Edmund fought him
again, and made him once more raise the siege. When
Edmund went into Wessex to gather new forces, Cnut began
a third siege, in which, also, 'by God's help,' he made no progress.</p>

<p>In twenty years, therefore, the City of London was besieged
six times, and not once taken.</p>

<p>Antiquaries have written a good deal on the colossal
nature of the canal constructed by Cnut; they have looked
for traces of it in the south of London before it was covered
over by houses; they have gone as far afield as Deptford in
search of these traces; they have even found them; and to
the present day every writer who has mentioned the canal
speaks of it and thinks of it with the respect due to a colossal
work. Freeman himself called it a 'deep ditch.' How deep
it was, how long it was, how broad it was, I am going to
explain.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1756 that the painstaking historian,
William Maitland, F.R.S., announced that he had been so
fortunate as to light upon the course of the long-lost trench of
King Cnut.</p>

<p>He had found certain evidence, he said, of its course, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
direction nearly east and west from the then 'New Dock' of
Rotherhithe to the river at the end of Chelsea Reach, through
Vauxhall Gardens. The proofs were, first, certain depressions
in the ground; next, the discovery of oaken planks and piles
driven into the ground for what he thought was the northern
fence of the canal, near the Old Kent Road; and next a
report that, in 1694, when the wet dock of Rotherhithe was
constructed, a quantity of hazel, willow, and other branches
were found pointing northward, with stakes to keep them in
position, forming a kind of water fence, such as, it is said, is still
in use in Denmark. It will be seen that Mr. Maitland's theory
has but a small basis of evidence, yet it seems to have been
generally accepted&mdash;partly, I suppose, because it was so
colossal.</p>

<p>The canal thus cut would actually be a little over four
miles and a half in length. Another writer, seeing the
difficulties of so great a work, suggests another course. He
would start from the site of the New Dock, Rotherhithe, and
end on the other side of London Bridge, a course of only
three and three-quarter miles!</p>

<p>Let us ask ourselves why it should be a 'deep' ditch; why
it should be a long ditch; why it should be a broad ditch.</p>

<p>Wherever Cnut began his trench, whether at Rotherhithe
or nearer the Bridge, he would have the same preliminary
difficulties to encounter: that is to say, he would have to
cut through the Embankment of the river at either end, and
he would have to cut through the Causeway in the middle.
In these cuttings he would perhaps have to take down two
or three houses, huts, or cabins, all deserted, because the
people had all run across the Bridge for safety at the first
sight of the Danes, if there were any people at the time
living in Southwark&mdash;which I doubt.</p>

<p>We may, further, take it for granted that Cnut had officers
of sense and experience on whom he could depend for carrying
out his canal in a workmanlike manner. A people who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
could build such perfect ships would certainly not waste
time and labour in constructing a trench which would be
any longer or deeper or wider than was absolutely necessary.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;"><a name="DIAGRAM" id="DIAGRAM"></a>
<img src="images/illus_054.jpg" width="420" height="310" alt="DIAGRAM" title="" />
</div>

<p>Now the shortest canal possible would be that in which
he was just able to drag his vessels round without destroying
the banks. In other words, if a circular canal began at C B,
and if we drew an imaginary circle round the middle of the
canal, what was required was that the chord D F, forming a
tangent to the middle circle, should be at least as long as the
longest vessel. Now (see diagram)&mdash;</p>

<p class='center'>
AD² - AE² = DE².<br />
</p>

<p>If <i>r</i> is the radius, AD and 2<i>a</i> the breadth BC, and 2<i>b</i> the
length of the chord DF&mdash;</p>

<p class='center'>
<i>r</i>² - (<i>r</i> - <i>a</i>)² = <i>b</i>² &#8756; <i>r</i> = (<i>a</i>² + <i>b</i>²)/2<i>a</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>This represents the length of the radius in terms of the
length and breadth of the largest vessel in the fleet, and is
therefore the smallest radius possible for getting the ships
through. Now, the ship of Gokstad, already described, was
undoubtedly one of the finest of the vessels used by Danes
and Normans. The poets certainly speak of larger ships,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
but as a marvel. Nothing is said about Cnut bringing over
ships of very great size. Now, that vessel was 66 feet in
length, considering the keel, which is all we need consider;
16½ feet in breadth, and 4 feet in depth. She drew very
little water; therefore a breadth of canal less than the breadth
of the vessel was enough. Let us make the chord 70 feet in
length, so that <i>b</i> = 35. Let us make the breadth of the canal
12 feet. Therefore 2<i>a</i> = 12 or <i>a</i> = 6 and <i>r</i> = 105 feet very nearly.
Measuring, therefore, 105 feet on either side of London
Bridge, we arrive at a possible commencement of Cnut's
work. That is to say, if he made a semicircular canal, in
that case the length of the canal would be 320 yards, which
is certainly an improvement on four miles and a half, or even
three miles and three-quarters.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;"><a name="THE_GOKSTAD_SHIP" id="THE_GOKSTAD_SHIP"></a>
<img src="images/illus_055.jpg" width="420" height="167" alt="THE GOKSTAD SHIP" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE GOKSTAD SHIP</span>
</div>

<p>There is, however, more to consider. Why should Cnut
make a semicircle when an arc would serve his turn? All
he had to do was to draw an arc of a circle with the radius
just found, to clear any obstacles in the way of approach to
the Bridge, and use that arc for his canal. This is most
certainly what he did: I am quite certain he adopted this
method, because it was the only sensible thing to do. He
would thus get off with a canal about fifty yards long, of
which the only difficulty would be the cutting through the
Embankment and the Causeway.</p>

<p>What would be the depth of the canal? Look at this
section of the Gokstad ship. With her breadth of sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
feet, she had only four feet in depth; without her company and
crew, and their arms and provisions, she would thus draw no
more than a few inches&mdash;certainly not more than eight
inches or so. Freeman's deep canal therefore comes to eight
inches at the most. But there is still another consideration
which lessened the labour materially. The ground behind
the Embankment was a little lower than the river at high
tide: the Danes, therefore, had only to construct a low
wooden containing-wall of timber on each side in order to
make their canal without excavating an inch. When that
was done, the cutting of the Embankment let in the tide and
did the rest. In this simple manner do we reduce Cnut's
colossal work of a deep canal, four miles and a half long, into
a piece of construction and demolition which would take a
large body of men no more than a few hours.</p>

<p>If, however, there actually was any digging to be done,
we must remember that the ground was a level; that there
were no stones or rocks in the way, and that it consisted of
a soft black <i>humus</i>, the result of ages of successive growths
of sedge and coarse grass, formerly washed twice a day by
the brackish waters of a tidal river. The object of the canal
once attained, the ships drawn back again, Cnut, of course,
left the place to be repaired by any who pleased. The
broken Embankment let in the tide; the broken Causeway
cut off any approach to the river; but Southwark was deserted.
When things settled down a little, workmen were
sent across from London, and the broken places were repaired.
Then all traces of the canal disappeared.</p>

<p>Thirty-six years later, in 1052, Earl Godwine arrived at
Southwark with a fleet and an army. He had no difficulty
in passing the Bridge; he waited till flood-tide, and then
sailed through 'on the south side.' It is quite impossible to
explain this statement, or to make it agree with the difficulty
felt by Cnut. The Bridge may have sustained some damage;
there may have been a drawbridge; or Godwine's ships may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
have been smaller: one knows nothing. I merely state the
fact as the Chronicler gives it.</p>

<p>One more glimpse of the Bridge from Southwark before
we pass on to more modern times.</p>

<p>After Hastings, William marched northwards. Arrived
near London, he advanced to Southwark, where he found the
Bridge closed to him&mdash;closed, I believe, by knocking away
some of the upper beams. This, of course, he expected; his
friends within the City, of whom he had many, kept him acquainted
with the changing currents of popular opinion. It
is commonly stated that the citizens were terrified by the
sight of Southwark in flames at his command. Southwark
in flames! A few fishermen's huts were all that remained of
the suburb, whose population since the time of the <i>Pax
Romana</i> had been so precarious and so changeful. Five
hundred years of battle, war between kings and tribes, invasion
and ravage by Dane and Norseman, had not left of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
Southwark, once so beautiful a suburb, anything more than
these poor huts and ruins of huts. William's soldiers burned
them, because wherever a soldier of that period appeared, the
thatch always caught fire spontaneously. William saw the
flames, and regarded them not, any more than he regarded
the flames that followed in his track all the way from Senlac.
He gazed across the river, and remembered that twice had
London defied all the strength of Swegen; that three times had
London beaten off the great King Cnut when all England
had surrendered; that in six sieges London had always been
victorious; he knew, because his friends in the City would
allow no mistake on that point, that the spirit of the citizens
was as high now as it had been then; that they still remembered
with pride the defeat of Cnut; and that not a few were
anxious to treat William the Norman as they had treated
Cnut the Dane. One knows not, exactly, what things went
on within the walls; what exhortations, what wild talk, what
faction fight; how the citizens rolled, and surged, a mass of
wild faces, about their Folk-mote by St. Paul's. But of one
thing we may be quite certain: that William did not expect
the citizens to be afraid of him; and that, in fact, they were
not afraid of him, whether he set fire to the huts of Southwark
or not; they were not afraid of William, whatever the historians
say. As for the Bridge, the old Roman Bridge, by this
time there could hardly have been a single pile remaining of
the original structure; yet it was constantly repaired.</p>

<p>We may restore to Norman London, therefore, not only
the grey wall rising out of the level ground, without any
ditch or moat outside, but also the Bridge of wooden piles
with the transverse girders and beams for additional security,
so that the old Bridge contained a whole forest of timbers
like those which support the roof of an ancient hall.
It was continually receiving damage. In the year 1091, a
mighty whirlwind blew down a good part of London, houses
and churches and all. It has been assumed that the Bridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
was also destroyed; but the 'Chronicle' is silent on the subject.
In 1092 there was a great fire in London; it is again assumed
that the Bridge was destroyed, but again the 'Chronicle' is
silent. In 1097, however, it is plainly stated that the Bridge
had been almost washed away, and that it was repaired.</p>

<p>In 1136 the most destructive fire ever experienced by
London, save that of 1666, spread through the whole City,
from London Bridge, which it greatly damaged, all the way
to St. Clement Danes on the west, and Aldgate on the east.
One wonders what ancient monuments&mdash;walls of Roman
churches, villas, and baths, still surviving halls and chambers
of the Forum&mdash;were destroyed in this fire; Saxon houses of
the better sort, with their great halls and courtyards; small
Saxon churches of wood or stone, with low towers and little
windows. Possibly there was no great loss: it was already
seven hundred years since Augusta was deserted. Roman
remains must have been scanty; the City was chiefly built of
wood, with thatched roofs; the splendour of the latter centuries
had not yet commenced. The Bridge, however, was
either wholly or in part destroyed. It was repaired, because,
fifty years later, FitzStephen, in his description of the City,
speaks of the citizens watching the water sports from the
Bridge. Indeed, the Bridge was now absolutely necessary to
the City. A hundred years of order in the City&mdash;with the seas
cleared of pirates, the Danes kept down, and merchants filling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
the river with ships, and the quays with merchandise&mdash;crowded
the Bridge all day long with trains of packhorses, and the less
frequent rude carts with broad grunting wheels which would
have quite taken the place of the horse but for the bad roads.
Southwark, during this period of rest, had become once more
a town, or at least a village. Still, along the Embankment
stood the thatched huts of the fisherfolk; but they were
pushed farther east and west every year, until Lambeth and
Rotherhithe were their quarters when the fish deserted the
river and their occupation was gone. The Roman inns were
gone, but new ones were springing up in their places. Bishops
and abbots were looking on Southwark as a place of fine air,
open to every breeze and free from the noise and crowd of
London; ecclesiastical foundations were already springing
into existence. In a word, the settlements of the south, after
four hundred years of ruin and desertion, were once more
beginning a new existence. The day when William rode up
to the south end of the Bridge, and looked across upon a
City that had not yet made up its mind about his reception,
marked a new birth for the long-suffering suburb of the
Embankment and the Causeway. A hundred years later
still&mdash;in 1176&mdash;they began to build their Bridge of Stone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III
<br />
<br />
A FORGOTTEN MONASTERY</h2>


<p>The earliest maps of South London are those of the sixteenth
century. But it is perfectly easy from them and from the
historical facts to draw a map of all that country lying between
Deptford and Battersea which we have agreed to call
South London. Thus, to put the map into words, there were
buildings all along both sides of the Causeway as far as St.
George's Church; in the middle of the Causeway stood St.
Margaret's Church, facing St. Margaret's Hill; on the right-hand
side, just under the Bridge, was St. Olave's Church.
The Bridge was thus protected on the north by St. Magnus,
on the south by St. Olave&mdash;two Danish saints&mdash;and in
the middle by the patron saint of its chapel, St. Thomas
à Becket. There were houses along the Embankment on
either side, but more on the west of the Causeway than on
the east. A few houses were built already on the low-lying
ground near the Causeway; for instance, on the south and
south-west of St. Mary Overies. On the east of St. Olave's
a single straight lane with no houses ran across country to
Bermondsey Abbey; on the west of the Causeway another
lane led to Kennington Palace, from which another lane led
to the Causeway from Lambeth and Westminster to the
Dover Road. That was the whole extent of Southwark.</p>

<p>The place was essentially a suburb. There were no
trades or industries in it, except that of fishing; the fishermen
had their cottages dotted about all along the Embankment;
a few watermen lived here, but that was perhaps later:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
other working men there were none, save the cooks and varlets
of the great houses, and the 'service' of the inns. Because
the air was fresh and pure, blown up daily with the tides; and
because the place was easy of access, by river, to Westminster
and the Court, many great men, ecclesiastics and nobles, had
their town houses here: the Bishop of Winchester, the Bishop
of Rochester, the Prior of Lewes, the Abbot of Hyde, the
Abbot of Battle, the Earls of Surrey, Sir John Fastolfe, also
the Brandons. Also, because it was easy of access by bridge
and river to the City, the merchants brought their goods and
warehoused them here in the inns at which they stayed, while
they went across the river and transacted their business. It
was a suburb which, in modern times, would be described as
needing no poor rate. Later on there grew up, as we shall
see, a class of the unclassed&mdash;a population of rogues and
vagabonds, thieves, and sanctuary birds.</p>

<p>The government of the place as a whole was difficult,
or rather impossible. There were several 'Liberties;' the
Liberty of Bermondsey; that of the Bishop of Winchester;
that of the King; that of the Mayor. The last contained the
part of the Borough lying between St. Saviour's Dock on the
west and Hay's Dock on the east, with a southern limit just
including St. Margaret's Church. This very small district
was called the Gildable Manor: it was conceded by the King
to the City of London in the thirteenth century in order to
prevent the place from becoming the home and refuge of
criminals from the City. As the other liberties remained outside
the jurisdiction of the City, the alleviation gained was
not very great: criminals still dropped across the river, finding
shelter on the Lambeth Marsh or the marsh between
Bermondsey and Rotherhithe. It was from this unavoidable
hospitality to persons escaping from justice that Southwark
received a character which has stuck to it till the present day.
In the centuries which include the twelfth to the fifteenth,
however, South London, so far as it was populated at all, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
the residence of great lords and the place of sojourn for merchants
from the country. As yet the reputation of Southwark
was spotless and its dignity enviable. London itself
had no such collection of palaces gathered together so closely.
As for the land, that lay low, but was protected by the
Embankment from the river. Many rivulets flowed slowly
across the misty meadows; many ponds lay about the flats;
there was an abundant growth of trees everywhere, so that
parts of the land were dark at midday by reason of the trees
growing so close together. The rivulets were pretty little
streams; willows grew over them; alders grew beside them;
they were coloured brown by the peaty soil; on their banks
grew wild flowers&mdash;the marsh mallow, the anemone, the
hedgehog grass, the frogbit, the crowfoot, and the bitter-wort;
orchards flourished in the fat and fertile soil. The people had
almost forgotten the special need of their Embankment.
Yet when, in the year 1242, the Embankment at Lambeth was
broken down, the river rushed in and covered six square miles
of country, including all that part which is now called
Battersea.</p>

<p>Remember, however, that as yet there was not a single
house upon the whole of Lambeth Marsh, nor upon the whole
of Bermondsey Marsh. The houses began near what is now
the south end of Blackfriars Bridge; they faced the river,
having gardens behind them. On the other side of the
Bridge the houses extended farther, going on nearly opposite
to Wapping.</p>

<p>The place was well provided with prisons; every Liberty
had its own prison. Thus there were the Clink of the
Winchester Liberty, that of the Bermondsey Liberty, the
'White Lion' of Surrey, the King's Bench, and the Marshalsea,
all in the narrow limits we have laid down. And
there were also, for the delectation of the righteous and the
terror of evil-doers, the visible instruments for correction. In
every parish there was the whipping post&mdash;one in St. Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
Overy's churchyard, put up after the time of the monks; one
at St. Thomas's Hospital; there was the pillory for neck and
hands, generally with somebody on it, but the pillory was
movable; there was the cage&mdash;one stood at the south end of
the Bridge&mdash;women had to stand in the cage; there were
stocks for feet wandering and trespassing; there were pounds
for stray animals.</p>

<p>Markets were held in the churchyard of St. Margaret's;
in the precinct of Bermondsey Abbey; and along the street
called 'Long Southwark'&mdash;now High Street&mdash;from the Bridge
to St. Margaret's Hill. But we must not suppose that the
markets of Southwark presented the same crowded appearance,
and were carried on with the same noise and bustle, as those of
Chepe and Newgate on the other side.</p>

<p>Everything, in those days, was quiet and dignified in
Southwark. The Princes of the Church arrived and departed,
each with his retinue of chaplains and secretaries, gentlemen
and livery. Kings and ambassadors rode up from Dover
through Long Southwark and across the Bridge. The mayor
and aldermen in new cloaks of red murrey and gold chains
sallied forth to meet the King returning from abroad. Cavalcades
of pilgrims for Canterbury, Compostella, Seville, Rome,
and Jerusalem rode out of Southwark when the spring returned;
and every day there arrived and departed long lines
of packhorses laden with the produce of the country and with
things imported for sale in London City. Pilgrims, merchants,
travellers, all put up at the Southwark inns. The place was
nothing but a collection of inns; the ecclesiastics stayed here
for a few weeks and then went away; the great lords came
here when they had business at Court and then went away
again; the merchants came and went: by itself the place
had, as yet, no independent life or character of its own
at all.</p>

<p>There were two Monastic Houses. Both were stately;
both are full of history. Let us consider the House of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
Bermondsey, because it is less generally known than the other
of St. Mary Overy or Overies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="The_Monastery_of_Bermondsey" id="The_Monastery_of_Bermondsey"></a>
<img src="images/illus_065.jpg" width="550" height="463" alt="The Monastery of Bermondsey" title="" />
<span class="caption">The Monastery of Bermondsey</span>
</div>

<p>The Abbey of St. Saviour, Bermondsey, was the Westminster
of South London. Like Westminster, Bermondsey
stood upon a low islet in the midst of a marsh; at the
distance of half a mile on the north ran the river; half a mile
on the west was the Causeway; half a mile on the south was
the Dover road. It is significant of the seclusion in which
the House lay that the
only road which connected
it with the world
was that lane called Bermondsey or Barnsie or Barnabie
Lane, which ran from the Abbey to St. Olave's and so to
London Bridge. It was not, like Westminster, a place
of traffic and resort. It lay alone and secluded, separated
from the noise and racket of life. When the marsh had been
gradually drained and the Embankment continued through
Rotherhithe to Deptford and beyond the Greenwich levels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
the Abbey lands round the islet became extremely fertile and
wooded and covered with sheep and cattle.</p>

<p>The House was founded in the year 1182 by one Ailwin
Childe, a merchant of the City, an Alderman also and one of
the ruling families of London. He was the son of an elder
Ailwin, who was a member of that 'Knighten Guild' which,
with all its members and all its property&mdash;the land which
now forms the Ward of Portsoken&mdash;went over to the Priory
of the Holy Trinity. Religion of a practical and real kind
was therefore hereditary in the family. The elder Ailwin
became a monk, the younger founded a monastery; his son,
the third of the family of whom we know anything, became
the first Mayor of London, and remained Mayor for twenty-four
years&mdash;the rest of his life.</p>

<p>The whole of history from the ninth to the fifteenth
century is full of a pathetic longing after a religious Order,
if that could be found, of true and proved sanctity. One
Order after the other arises; one after the other challenges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
respect for reputed holiness of a new and hitherto unknown
kind: in fact, it commands the respect of the people who
always admire voluntary privation of what they value so
much&mdash;food and drink; it receives endowments, gifts,
foundations of all kinds; it then departs from the ancient
rule, and quickly loses its hold upon the people. This is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
simple history of Benedictine, Franciscan, Cistercian, and all
the rest. However, at the close of the eleventh century the
Cluniac was in the highest repute for a rigid Rule, strictly
kept: and for an austerity strictly enforced. It was a
Cluniac House which Ailwin Childe set up in Bermondsey,
and which Earl de Warren, who also founded the Cluniac
House of Lewes, enriched.</p>

<p>This Priory, with thirty-seven other Houses, was an Alien
owing obedience to the Abbot of Cluny. A large part of its
revenues, therefore, was sent out of the country, and it received
its Priors from abroad. In the reign of Henry the
Fifth the growing dissatisfaction on account of the Alien
Priories came to a head, and they were all suppressed, or at
least cut off from obedience to the Mother Convent. The
Priory of Bermondsey was therefore raised to the dignity of
an Abbey, with an English Abbot, and so continued until
the Dissolution.</p>

<p>The Abbey was one of the many places of pilgrimage
dotted about round London&mdash;places accessible in a single
day's journey. Thus there were the three shrines of Willesden,
Muswell Hill, and Gospel Oak, each possessing an
image of the Virgin to which miraculous powers were
attributed. At Blackheath there was another holy shrine; at
Bermondsey there was a Holy Rood which was daily visited
in the summer by pious pilgrims from London. The Rood
had been fished up from the Thames, and no one knew its
history; but the merit of a pilgrimage to the Abbey and of
prayers said before the shrine was considered very precious.
It was, moreover, an easy pilgrimage. A boat taken below
the Bridge would take the pilgrim over to the opposite shore
in a few minutes, where a cross standing before a lane leading
out of 'Short Southwark' showed him the way. It was
but half a mile to the Abbey of St. Saviour and the Holy
Rood.</p>

<p>'Go,' writes John Paston in 1465 to his mother, 'visit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
Rood of North door and St. Saviour in Bermondsey among
while ye abide in London; and let my sister Margery go
with you to pray to them that she may have a good husband
or she come home again.'</p>

<p>One can hardly expect that the Abbot of Cluny should
resign this valuable possession without a remonstrance. He
made, in fact, the strongest possible remonstrance. In 1457
he sent over three monks with orders to lay the case before
the King, and to invite his attention especially to the papers
showing the clear and indisputable right of the Mother Convent
to the House of Bermondsey. These monks, in fact, did
present their case to the King, with the documents. But no
one heeded them; they could hardly get a hearing; no one
replied to their arguments. This neglect was perhaps the
cause why one of them died while in this country. The
other two went home again, having accomplished nothing.
One of them on the eve of their departure wrote a piteous
letter to the Abbot of St. Albans:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>For the rest, be it known to you, my Lord, that after having
spent four months and a half on our journey, and following our
Right with the most serene Lord the King and his Privy Council, we
have obtained nothing: nay, we are sent back very disconsolate,
deprived of our Manors, our Pensions alienated, and, what is still
worse, we are denied the obedience of all our Monasteries which
are 38 in number: nor did our Legal Deeds, nor the Testimonies
of your Chronicles avail us anything, and at length, after all our
pleading and expenses, we return home moneyless, for in truth,
after paying for what we have eaten and drunk, we have but five
crowns left, to go back about 260 leagues. But what then? We
will sell what we have: we will go on: and God will provide.
Nothing else occurs to write to your Paternity: but that as we
entered England with joy, so we depart thence with sorrow: having
buried one of our Companions&mdash;viz. the Archdeacon, the youngest
of our company. May he rest in Peace! Amen.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is not at the present moment a single stone of
this stately House visible, though there were many remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
above ground one hundred years ago. It is a pity, because
there is the association of two Queens, not to speak of many
great Lords of state Functions, and of Parliaments, connected
with this House secluded in the Marsh.</p>

<p>The first of the two Queens is Katharine of Valois,
widow of Henry the Fifth. The story is the most romantic,
perhaps, of all the stories connected with our line of sovereigns
and Queens and Royal Princes. It is not a new story,
and yet it is not so well known that any apology is needed
for telling it once more.</p>

<p>Henry died August 31, 1422. His widow, Katharine,
began to live in the seclusion fitted for her sorrow and her
widowhood. Among her household, the office of Clerk to the
Wardrobe was filled by a young and handsome Welshman
named Owen Tudor, or Theodore. He was the son of a
plain Welsh gentleman of slender means, if any, who was in
the service of the Bishop of Chester. He distinguished
himself at Agincourt in the following of some nobleman
unknown. It has been said, with singular ignorance of the
time, that he was a private soldier&mdash;that is, a man with a pike
or a bow, dressed in a leather jerkin which the men threw
off when the battle began. The opportunities for a common
soldier to distinguish himself in such an action were few,
nor do we ever hear of a king raising a man from the
ranks, as Henry raised Owen Tudor, to the post of Esquire
to the Body. It is possible, but most improbable, that Owen
Tudor was regarded as a common soldier: since his father
was a gentleman in the service of the Bishop of Chester, he
himself would go to war as a gentleman in the service and
wearing the livery of some noble lord.</p>

<p>In this way, however, his promotion began. When the
King married, Owen Tudor was attached to the household
of the Queen. After the death of Henry he accompanied
the Queen and remained in her service as Clerk to the
Wardrobe. In this office he had to buy whatever was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
wanted by the Queen&mdash;her silk, her velvet, her cloth of gold.
He was therefore brought into much closer and more direct
relation with the Queen than other officers of the household.
He pleased her by his appearance, his accomplishments,
and his manners. Tradition says that he danced very well.
There is no reason to inquire by what attractions or accomplishments
he pleased. The fact remains that he did please
the Queen, and that so much that she consented to a
secret marriage with him. It was a dangerous step for this
Welsh adventurer to take: it was a step which would cover
the Queen with dishonour should it become known. That
the widow of the great and glorious Henry, chief captain of
the age, should be able to forget her husband at all; should
be capable of union with any lower man; should ally her
royal line with that of a man who could only call himself
gentleman after the fashion of Wales: would certainly be
considered to bring dishonour on the King, the royal family,
and the country at large.</p>

<p>The marriage was not found out for some years. The
Queen must have been most faithfully and loyally served,
because children cannot be born without observation. Owen
Tudor must have conducted matters with a discretion beyond
all praise. No doubt the ordinary members of the household
knew nothing and suspected nothing, because several years
passed before any suspicion was awakened. Three sons and
one daughter, in all, were born. The eldest, Edmund of
Hadham, was so called because he was born there; the
second, Jasper, was of Hatfield; the third, Owen, of Westminster;
the youngest, Margaret, died in infancy.</p>

<p>Suspicions were aroused about the time of the birth of
Owen, which took place apparently before it was expected
and without all the precautions necessary, in the King's
House at Westminster. The infant was taken as soon as
born to the monastery of St. Peter's, secretly. It is not
likely that the Abbot received the child without full knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
of his parents. He did take the child, however; and
here the little Owen remained, growing up in a monastery,
and taking vows in due time. Here he lived and here he
died, a Benedictine of Westminster.</p>

<p>It would seem as if Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester,
heard some whisper or rumour concerning this birth, or was
told something about the true nature of the Queen's illness,
for he issued a very singular proclamation, warning the
world, generally, against marrying Queen dowagers, as if
these ladies grew on every hedge. When, however, a year
or so afterwards, the fourth child, Margaret, was born,
Humphrey learned the whole truth: the degradation, as he
thought it, of the Queen, who had stooped to such an alliance,
and the humble rank and the audacity of the Welshman.
He took steps promptly. He sent Katharine with
some of her ladies to Bermondsey Abbey, there to remain
in honourable confinement: he arrested Owen Tudor, a
priest&mdash;probably the priest who had performed the marriage&mdash;and
his servant, and sent all three to Newgate.</p>

<p>All three succeeded in breaking prison, and escaped. At
this point the story gets mixed. The King himself, we are
told, then a lad of fifteen, sent to Owen commanding his
attendance before the Council. Why did they not arrest him
again? Owen, however, refused to trust himself to the
Council&mdash;was not Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, one of
them? He asked for a safe-conduct. They promised him
one by a verbal message. Where was he, then, that all these
messages should be sent backwards and forwards? I think
he must have been in Sanctuary. He refused a verbal
message, and demanded a written safe-conduct. This was
granted him, and he returned to London. But he mistrusted
even the written promise; he would not face the Council: he
took refuge in the Sanctuary of Westminster, where they
were afraid to seize him. And here for a while he remained.
It is said that they tried to draw him out by sending old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
friends who invited him to the taverns outside the Abbey
Precinct. But Owen would not be so drawn. He knew
that Duke Humphrey would make an end of him if he could.
He therefore remained where he was. I think that he must
have had some secret understanding with the King; for one
day, learning that Henry himself was with the Council, he
suddenly presented himself and pleaded his own cause. The
mild young king, tender on account of his mother, would
not allow the case to be pursued, but bade him go free.</p>

<p>He departed; he made all haste to get out of an unwholesome
air: he made for Wales. Here the hostility
of Duke Humphrey pursued him still: he was once more
arrested, taken to Wallingford, and placed in the Castle there
a prisoner. From Wallingford he was transferred again to
Newgate, he and his priest and his servant. Once more they
all three broke prison, 'foully' wounding a warder in the
achievement of liberty, and got back to Wales, choosing for
their residence the mountainous parts into which the English
garrisons never penetrated.</p>

<p>When the King came of age Owen Tudor was allowed
to return, and was presented with a pension of £40 a year.
It is remarkable, however, that he received no promotion,
or rank; that he was never knighted; and that the title of
Esquire was the only one by which he was known. It certainly
seems as if the claim of Owen Tudor to be called a
gentleman was not recognised by the King or the heralds.
Perhaps Welsh gentility was as little understood by these
Normans as Irish royalty&mdash;yet, so far as length of pedigree
goes, both Welsh and Irish were very superior to Normans.</p>

<p>The two sons, Edmund and Jasper, were placed under
the charge of Katharine de la Pole, Abbess of Barking, and
sister of the Earl of Suffolk. When the King came of age
he remembered his half-brothers: Edmund was made Earl
of Richmond, Jasper Earl of Pembroke; both ranked before
all other English Earls. Edmund was afterwards married to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
Margaret Beaufort, who as Countess of Richmond was the
foundress of Christ's and St. John's Colleges, Cambridge.
Her son, as everybody knows, was Henry VII.</p>

<p>As for Owen Tudor, that gallant adventurer, who began
so well on the field of battle, ended as well, fighting, as he
should, for his step-son and King, under the badge of the Red
Rose. When the Civil Wars began he joined the King's
forces, though he was then nearer seventy than sixty. He
fought at Wakefield; he pursued the Yorkists to Mortimer's
Cross, where another fight took place. The Lancastrians
were defeated. Owen was taken prisoner, and was cruelly
beheaded on the field. It was right and just that he should
so fight and should so die. He survived his Queen twenty-four
years.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Katharine, whose <i>mésalliance</i> gave us
the strongest sovereigns we have ever had over us, did not
long survive the disgrace of discovery. As to public knowledge
of the fact, one cannot learn how widely it was extended.
Probably it grew by degrees: chroniclers speak of
it without reserve, and when the sons grew up and were
acknowledged by the King there was no pretence at concealment.
To be the son of a French Princess and a Welsh
gentleman was not, after all, a matter for shame or concealment.
Katharine carried down to the Abbey a disorder
which she calls of long standing and grievous. It killed her
in less than a year after her imprisonment among the
orchards and meadows of the Precinct. It is said that her
remorse during her last days was very deep; not for her
second marriage, but for having allowed her accouchement
of the King to take place at Windsor, a place against
which she was warned by the astrologer. 'Henry of Windsor
shall lose all that Henry of Monmouth shall win.' Alas!
had Henry of Windsor been Henry of Monmouth himself,
he would have lost all there was to lose. Could there be a
worse prospect, had Katharine understood the dangers, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
hereditary disease? On the one side the grandson of a leper
and the son of a consumptive; on the other side, the grandson
of a madman and a Messalina.</p>

<p>Katharine dictated her will a few days before her death.
She asks for masses for her soul: for rewards for her servants:
for her debts to be paid. And she says not one word about
her children by Owen Tudor. She confesses by this silence
that she is ashamed. She confesses by this silence that, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
a Queen, and of a Royal House, she ought not in her widowhood
to have been mated with any less than a King.</p>

<p>'I trustfully,' she says in the preamble, addressing her son
the King, 'and am right sure, that among all creatures earthly
ye best may and will best tender and favour my will, in
ordaining for my soul and body, in seeing that my debts be
paid and my servants guerdoned, and in tender and favourable
fulfilment of mine intent.' The words are full of queenly
dignity; but&mdash;where is the mention of her children?
Perhaps, however, she knew that the King would provide for
them.</p>

<p>Another Queen died here: the Queen 'to whom all griefs
were known'&mdash;Elizabeth Woodville. It is not easy to feel
much sympathy with this unfortunate woman, yet there are
few scenes of history more full of pathos and of mournfulness
than that in which her boy was torn from her arms; and she
knew&mdash;all knew&mdash;even the Archbishops, when they gave their
consent, knew&mdash;that the boy was to be done to death. When
one talks of Queens and their misfortunes, it may be
remembered that few Queens have suffered more than
Elizabeth Woodville. In misfortune she sits apart from other
Queens, her only companions being Mary Queen of Scots and
Marie Antoinette. Her record is full of woe. But in that
long war it seems impossible to find one single character, man
or woman&mdash;unless it is King Henry&mdash;who is true and loyal.
All&mdash;all&mdash;are perjured, treacherous, cruel, self-seeking. All
are as proud as Lucifer. Murder is the friend and companion
of the noblest lord; perjury walks on the other side of him;
treachery stalks behind him: all are his henchmen. Elizabeth
met perjury and treachery with intrigue and plot and
counter-plot: she was the daughter of her time. She was
accused of being privy to the plots of Lambert Simnel and
Perkin Warbeck: she was more Yorkist than her husband;
she hated the Red Rose long after the Red and the White
were united by her daughter and Henry the Seventh. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
she was suspected of these intrigues shows the character she
bore. We must make allowance: she was always in a false
position; Edward ought not to have married her; she was
hated by her own party; she was compelled in the interests
of her children to be always on the defensive; and in her
conduct of defence she was the daughter of her age. These
things, however, deprive her, somewhat, of the pity which we
ought to feel for so many misfortunes.</p>

<p>She, too, had to retire to the seclusion of Bermondsey,
where she could sit and watch the ships go up and down,
and so feel that the world, with which she had no more concern,
still continued. It has been suggested that she retired
voluntarily to the Abbey. Such a retreat was not in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
character of Elizabeth Woodville, so long as there was a
daughter or a kinsman left to fight for. Like Katharine of
Valois, she made an end not without dignity. Witness the
following clause in her will:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Item.</i> Whereas I have no worldly goods with which to do the
Queen's Grace, my dearest daughter, a pleasure, neither to reward
any of my children, according to my heart and mind, I beseech God
Almighty to bless her Grace with all her noble Issue, and, with as
good a heart and mind as may be, I give her Grace aforesaid my
blessing and all the aforesaid my children.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this chapter it has been my endeavour to restore an
ecclesiastical foundation which has somehow dropped out of
history and become no more than a name. If this were a
history of South London it would be necessary to devote an
equal space to other houses; to the churches and to the
two ancient hospitals 'Le Loke' and St. Thomas's. It is
impossible, even in these narrow limits, to speak of the
religious foundations of South London without mention of the
other great House, more ancient than that of Bermondsey.
Few Americans who visit London leave it without paying a
pilgrimage to the venerable and beautiful church which
glorifies Southwark. There were great marriages and great
functions held in the Church of St. Mary Overy: Gower, that
excellent poet whom the professors of literature praise and
nobody reads, died and lies buried in this church; it was the
church of the playerfolk: here lie buried Edmund Shakespeare,
John Fletcher, Philip Massinger, and Philip Henslow. Here
lie buried, in that 'sure and certain hope' which the Church
allows even to them, the rufflers, 'roreres' and sinners of
Bank Side and Maiden Lane; the brawlers and the topers
and the strikers of the Bear Garden and the Bull Baiting.
Here were tried notable heretics: Hooper and Rogers, and
many more, while Gardiner and Bonner thundered and bullied.
From this church the martyrs went forth to meet the flames.
The people of Southwark needed not to cross the river in
order to learn such lessons as the martyrdoms had to teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
them. The stake was set up in St. George's Fields, where
they could read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest the undesigned
teaching of Bonner and his friends.</p>

<p>It is the custom of historians to point to the martyrdom
of Cranmer and the Bishops as the chief cause of the overwhelming
Protestant reaction. So great was the horror, they
say, of the people at the death of the Archbishop, that the
whole nation was roused&mdash;and so on. For myself I like to
think that, as the people would feel now, so, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>,
they felt then. Was there any such mighty horror felt in
London when Cranmer died in Oxford? Not so much
horror, I believe, as when from their own ranks, from their
own houses, from their own families, men and women
and boys were taken out and led to execution. Violent
deaths&mdash;by beheading, by hanging, by the flames&mdash;were
witnessed every day. How many were hanged by
Henry VIII.? The deaths of nobles did not touch the
people; they looked on unmoved while the most innocent and
most holy men in the country&mdash;the blameless Carthusians&mdash;suffered
death as traitors; they looked on at the death of Sir
Thomas More; when witches were burned they looked on.
It was when they saw their own brothers, sisters, cousins,
dragged out and put to death without a cause, that they
began to doubt and to question. Nay, I think it was not the
manner of death that affected them, because burning was a
thing so common: it was the sentence itself passed on honest
and godly folk, and the behaviour of the people at their
death. Tender women chained to the stake suffered without
a groan, only praying loudly till death came; people remembered,
they recalled with tears afterwards, how the martyr
and his wife and his children knelt on the ground for one last
prayer before the stake; they remembered how the sufferer
stepped into his place with a smiling face and welcomed the
fiery lane that led him to the place where he longed to be:
was this, they asked, the courage inspired of God, or of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
devil? They remembered how another washed his hands in
the mounting and roaring flames; how the clouds parted at
the prayer of another, and the smiling sun of heaven shone
upon him; and it was even like unto the countenance of the
Blessed Lord. The sight and the remembrance of the
sufferings of their own folk, not the execution at a distance of
an Archbishop and a few Bishops, moved the people and
remained with them, and enveloped the Church of Rome
with a hatred from which it has not wholly recovered even in
these latter days.</p>

<p>The foundation of St. Thomas's Hospital belongs to both
the great Houses of Southwark.</p>

<p>It was the general Rule in all religious Houses that there
should be a provision for the poor, the sick, and those who
were orphans. St. Mary Overy had a hospital adjoining the
priory which was an almshouse certainly, and probably an
orphanage as well. It was under the care of the Archdeacon
of Surrey. Attached to St. Saviour's was an almonry intended
for the same purpose. But the Abbey was entirely
secluded: it lay far from any highway; there were no houses,
except farm buildings for the monastery's labourers; there
were no poor, no sick, and no orphans. So that, when the
great fire of 1213 destroyed Southwark and crossed the river
by the Bridge into London, the monks of St. Saviour's
bethought them that to make their almonry useful it would
be well to rebuild it half a mile to the west, on the Southwark
Causeway. This was done, and the Hospital of St. Mary
was united with it, and the new foundation which Bishop
Peter de Rupibus most liberally endowed was named after
St. Thomas. At first it was not a hospital especially for the
sick, as St. Bartholomew's and St. Mary of Spittal. It was a
fraternity like St. Catherine's by the Tower, for brethren and
sisters under a master, with bedesmen and women, and a
school, and an infirmary; but not, as St. Bartholomew's
was from the beginning altogether, only a hospital for the sick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 377px;"><a name="REMAINS_OF_THE_PALACE_OF_THE_BISHOP_OF_WINCHESTER" id="REMAINS_OF_THE_PALACE_OF_THE_BISHOP_OF_WINCHESTER"></a>

<span class="caption">REMAINS OF THE PALACE OF THE BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, FROM THE SOUTH</span>
</div>

<p>As for the religious life of the place, it was in most
respects like that of London. There were no houses for
Friars, but the Friars came across the river <i>en quête</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
'mumping,' on their begging rounds; and in the taverns were
put up boxes for the contributions of the faithful (towards the
end these contributions fell off sadly). There was plenty of
life and colour in the streets: serving men in bright liveries
of the great Houses&mdash;the Bishops of Winchester and Rochester,
the Abbots of Lewes, Hyde, and Battle&mdash;went about their
errands; there were Gilds, notably that of St. George, which
had their processions and their days: there were crosses and
images of saints, at which the passer-by doffed his hat&mdash;in
the wall of Lambeth Palace was an image of St. Thomas à
Becket overlooking the river, to which every waterman and
bargee paid reverence.</p>

<p>Some of the punishments of the time were ordered by
the Church. There was whipping, but not the terrible
murderous flogging of the eighteenth century; there were
hangings, but not for everything. Mostly to the credit
of the Church, punishment was designed not to crush
a man, but to shame him into repentance, and to give him a
chance of retrieving his character. A man might be set in
the stocks, or put in pillory, and so made to feel the heinousness
of his offence. This punishment was like that which is
inflicted on a schoolboy: the thing done, the boy is taken
back to favour. The eighteenth century branded him, imprisoned
him, transported him, made a brute of him, and
then hanged him. Did a woman speak despitefully of
authority? Presumptuous quean! Set her up in the cage
besides the stoulpes of London Bridge, that everyone should
see her there and should ask what she had done. After an
hour or two take her down; bid her go home and keep
henceforth a quiet tongue in her head. This leniency was
only for offences moral and against the law. For freedom of
thought or doctrine there was Bishop Bonner's better way.
And it was a way inhuman, inflexible, unable to forgive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV
<br />
<br />
THE ROYAL HOUSES OF SOUTH LONDON</h2>


<p>All round London, like beads upon a string, were dotted
Royal Houses, Palaces, and Hunting Places. On the north side
were Westminster, Whitehall, St. James's, Kensington, Shene,
Theobald's, Hatfield, Cheshunt, King's Langley, Hunsdon,
Havering-atte-Bower, Stepney, the Tower; on the south
side were Kennington, Eltham, Greenwich, Kew, Hampton,
Windsor, a tradition attaching to Streatham, and the House
of Nonesuch, built by Henry VIII. at Cheam. Most of these
royal houses are now clean forgotten. Eltham preserves
some ruins left of Edward IV.'s buildings; it still shows the
moat and the old bridge, and the line of its former wall; but
tradition, which has quite forgotten its memories of the
Edwards and the Tudors, describes it as the Palace of King
John. The sailors&mdash;now, alas! also gone&mdash;have deprived
Greenwich of Edward VI. and Elizabeth. Theobald's is gone
altogether, Nonesuch is wholly cleared away. Of Kennington,
of which I have to speak in this place, not one stone remains
upon another; not a vestige is above ground; the people on
the spot know of no remains underground; its very memory is
gone and forgotten: there is not even a tradition left, although
part of the ruins were still standing only a hundred years
ago.</p>

<p>The reason for this oblivion is not far to seek. The palace
was deserted; it was pulled down before 1607&mdash;Camden says
that even then there was not a stone remaining&mdash;there was
not a single house within half a mile in every direction. There
was no one, when the last stones had been carted away, left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
to remember or to remind his children that there had been a
palace on this spot. Another house was built here, but no
tradition attached to it. Two hundred years passed, and then
came the destruction of the second house; in 1745 there was
not even a cottage near the spot. This being so, it is not
difficult to understand why the site was forgotten.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;"><a name="THE_LONG_BARN" id="THE_LONG_BARN"></a>
<img src="images/illus_084.jpg" width="420" height="251" alt="THE LONG BARN" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE LONG BARN</span>
</div>

<p>The moat remained, however, and apparently some of the
substructures; a building of stone and thatch, part of the
offices of the palace, also stood. They called it the 'Long
Barn,' and when the distressed Protestants were brought over
here in 1700 as many as the place would hold were crammed
into the Long Barn. Market gardens lay all over the country
between Kennington Road and Lambeth, and on the site of
the palace there was not a single person left who could carry
on the tradition of the king's house that once stood here.
Roque, the map-maker of 1745, knew nothing about it. In
1795 the Long Barn was taken down. At the beginning of
the century houses began to rise here and there; streets
began to be formed: at least three streets cross the gardens
and the site of the palace; but there is not one tradition of a
place which, as we shall see, was full of history for six hundred
years. 'Is this fame?' might ask the king who crowned
himself here, the king who died here, the king who was brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
up here, the kings who kept their Christmas feast here, the
kings who here received their brides, held Parliament, and
went out a-hunting.</p>

<p>The king who crowned himself here was Harold Harefoot,
son of Cnut&mdash;that is to say, it was at 'Lambeth,' and there
was no other house at Lambeth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;"><a name="SKETCH_MAP_II" id="SKETCH_MAP_II"></a>
<img src="images/illus_085.jpg" width="410" height="338" alt="SKETCH MAP" title="" />
<span class="caption">SKETCH MAP</span>
</div>

<p>The king who died in this house was that young Dane
who appears to have been an incarnation of the ideal Danish
brutality. He dragged his brother's body out of its grave and
flung it into the Thames; he massacred the people of Worcester
and ravaged the shire; and he did these brave deeds
and many others all in two short years. Then he went to his
own place. His departure was both fitting and dramatic.
For one so young it showed with what a yearning and
madness he had been drinking. He went across the river&mdash;there
was, I repeat, no other house in Lambeth except this,
so that it must have been here&mdash;to attend the wedding of his
standard-bearer, Tostig the Proud, with Goda, daughter of the
Thane Osgod Clapa, whose name survives in his former estate
of Clapham. A Danish wedding was always an occasion for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
hard drinking, while the minstrels played and sang and the
mummers tumbled. When men were well drunken the pleasing
sport of bone throwing began: they threw the beef bones at
each other. The fun of the game consisted in the accident of a
man not being able to dodge the bone which struck him, and
probably killed him. Archbishop Alphege was thus killed.
The soldiers had no special desire to kill the old man: why
couldn't he enter into the spirit of the game and dodge the
bones? As he did not, of course he was hit, and as the bone
was a big and a heavy bone, hurled by a powerful hand, of
course it split open his skull. One may be permitted to think
that perhaps King Hardacnut, who is said to have fallen down
suddenly when he 'stood up to drink,' did actually intercept a
big beef bone which knocked him down; and as he remained
comatose until he died, the proud Tostig, unwilling to have it
said that even in sport his king had been killed at his wedding,
gave out that the king fell down in a fit. This, however, is
speculation.</p>

<p>Forty years after this event, when Domesday Book was
compiled, the place was in the possession of a London citizen,
Theodric by name and a goldsmith by trade. It was still a
royal manor, because the goldsmith held it of Edward the
Confessor. It was then valued at three pounds a year. It is
impossible to arrive at the meaning of this valuation. We
may compare it with that of other estates, with the rental and
price of other lands, with the cost of provisions, and with the
wages and pay of servants and officers; and when we have
done all, we are still very far from understanding the value of
money then or at any subsequent time. There are, you see,
so many points which the writers on the value of money do
not take into consideration. There is the price of bread;
but then there were so many kinds of bread&mdash;wheaten bread,
barley bread, oat bread, rye bread; and how much bread did
a family of the working class consume? Flesh, fish, fowl,
but how much of either did the working classes enjoy? Rent?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
But on the farms the "villains" paid no rent. There is, in a
word, not only the market prices that have to be considered,
but the standard of comfort&mdash;always a little higher than the
practice&mdash;and the daily relations of the demand to the supply.
So that when we read that this manor of Kennington was
worth three pounds a year we are not advanced in the least.
As most of the land was still marshy and useless, we may
understand that the value was low.</p>

<p>We next hear of Kennington in 1189, when King
Richard granted it on lease, or for life, to Sir Robert Percy
with the title of Lord of the Manor. Henry III. came here
on several occasions; here he held his Lambeth Parliament.
He kept his Christmas here in 1231. Great was the feasting
and boundless the hospitality of this Christmas, at which this
king lavished the treasures of the State.</p>

<p>The site of the palace is indicated in the accompanying
map. If you walk along the Kennington Road from Bridge
Street, Westminster, you presently come to a place where
four roads meet, Upper Kennington Lane on the left, and
Lower Kennington Lane on the right; the road goes on to
the Horns Tavern and Kennington Park. On the right-hand
side stood the palace. In the year 1636 a plan of the house
and grounds was executed; but by that time the mediæval
character of the place was quite forgotten. It was a square
house, probably Elizabethan; the home of King Henry III.
at some time or other had been completely taken away. The
site of the moat, however, was left, and there was still standing
the 'Long Barn.' The only way to find out what the
palace really was in the thirteenth or fourteenth century is to
compare it with another palace built under much the same
conditions, and intended to serve the same purpose. Fortunately
there still stand, some miles to the east of Kennington,
at Eltham, important remains of such a contemporary
palace, with a description of the place as it was before it was
allowed to fall into ruins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span></p>

<p>We are not at this moment concerned with the history of
Eltham. Sufficient to note that it was a great and stately
place for five hundred years and more; that it passed through
the hands of Bishop Odo; of the Mandevilles; of the De
Vescis; of Bishop Anthony Bec; and of Geoffrey le Scrope
of Masham. As a royal residence its history begins with
Henry III., who kept his Christmas here in 1270, and ends
with Elizabeth, who came over here occasionally from
Greenwich. Here Isabella, wife of Edward II., gave birth
to a son, John of Eltham. The greatest builder at Eltham
was Edward IV.</p>

<p>The house in 1649, fifty years after Elizabeth had visited
it, is said to have contained a chapel, a banqueting-hall, rooms
on the ground floor and first floor called the King's side and
the Queen's side. There were buildings and rooms of all
kinds round the courtyard. The number of chambers in all
was very great, and it is said, further, that the large courtyard
covered a whole acre in extent. Such an area
would give about two hundred and ten feet to each side of a
square. This would be large for a college at Oxford or
Cambridge. It would cover about the same area as that of
New Palace Yard. There were, however, other courts; four
courts in all are spoken of. The lesser courts were used for
the 'service,' the kitchens, butteries, pantries, stables, rooms
for the servants, the barracks for the men-at-arms who
accompanied the king, the grooms, armourers, makers and
menders, bakers and brewers, cooks and scullions, and the
women servants, and the wives and the children. A strong
stone wall, battlemented, with loopholed turrets, surrounded
the palace; a broad and deep moat defended the wall; the
bridge which crossed the moat had a drawbridge; the gate
had its portcullis. The palace, in a word, was a fortress, for
there was never a king in England who would have dared to
keep his court, or to sleep, in an unfortified manor house, or
outside a fortress&mdash;certainly not Henry III. or Edward IV.&mdash;unless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
of course, it was on the tented field in the midst of
his army.</p>

<p>The existing remains of the palace correspond to this
description. There is the moat, deep and broad; there is the
bridge, the drawbridge gone. Within, the most important
ruin is that of Edward IV.'s banqueting hall. This is a most
noble chamber, with a roof of oak as perfect as when it was
built; the two magnificent
bays remain, with
the double row of windows.
It would be
difficult to find a finer
banqueting hall in the
whole country than
that of Eltham. In the
grounds, the traces of
the wall and those of
other buildings ought
to make it possible,
with a very little excavation,
to trace a plan
of the whole house.</p>

<span class="caption">Gateway in the Hall, Eltham Palace</span>
</div>

<p>As was Eltham, so
was Kennington. Both
places were built for
the same purpose about
the same time. Both
were castles erected on a plain without the aid of hillock,
mound or running stream&mdash;unless the moat at Kennington was
fed by one of the many streams of South London. The plan
of 1636 shows approximately the line of the wall; the stream
or the ditch marks the course of the moat; the 'Long Barn'
on the east side of the palace belonged to the 'service'&mdash;it
was kitchens, stables, armoury, brewery, or granary. The
house itself had its principal entrance on the north. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
certain, because all the supplies were brought by what is
now Kennington Road either from Westminster Ferry or
from Southwark. A gate on this side simplified the
transference which took place when the court moved from
one place to another; when everything&mdash;bedding, blankets,
utensils of all kinds, plate, <i>batterie de cuisine</i>, the workmen
with their tools, the wardrobe of king and queen&mdash;was packed
up and carried from Westminster over the ferry to Kennington,
or from Kennington to Woolwich. Provisions and goods
sent up from the City were also landed at Stangate, Lambeth,
so as to get as short a land journey as possible. For these
reasons I place the principal gate at the north.</p>

<p>I have seen it stated&mdash;I know not with what truth&mdash;that
the people of the streets now on the site have found substructures
beneath their houses. If so, one would expect,
what one cannot find, some tradition to account for the
existence of these stone vaults.</p>

<p>Such was the vanished Palace of Kennington: a fortress
of the Lambeth Marsh, a place for keeping Christmas, a royal
residence; now completely vanished.</p>

<p>Two other royal houses there were in South London,
neither of which can be compared with Kennington. Greenwich,
for instance, which appears in history from the time of
King Alfred. Edward I., Henry IV., Henry V., Edward IV.,
Henry VII., Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Elizabeth&mdash;all
had more or less to do with Greenwich. When Henry VIII.
completed his buildings here he deserted Eltham; he left,
that is, the mediæval fortress for the modern house. His
Greenwich was not fortified. The accompanying view of it
shows that it possessed none of the characteristics of the
ancient residence, half castle, half manor house. Greenwich,
however, before Henry rebuilt it, was a fortified castle. Had
we a plan of Greenwich of the fourteenth century it would
most certainly resemble those of Eltham and of Kennington,
with certain small differences, just as one Benedictine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
monastery resembles in its general disposition another Benedictine
monastery, and one Norman castle in general terms,
and allowing for the site, resembles another.</p>

<p>The other house of which I have spoken is that of
Nonesuch. This house was not a reconstruction and an
adaptation with much of the ancient work: it was newly
built and furnished entirely by Henry VIII. There was no
suspicion of battlements, no pretence at a fortification; the
house stood open and unprotected save by the order maintained
by the strong
king. It was not beautiful
according to our
ideas; nor was it what
we now call a Tudor
house; it bears upon it every mark of the builder's interference
with the architect. The outside walls of Nonesuch were
decorated by certain bas-reliefs representing subjects from
the heathen mythology. The house was pulled down by
the Duchess of Cleveland, to whom Charles II. gave it.
Nonesuch, however, has nothing to do with Kennington, and
must not detain us.</p>

<span class="caption">The Ancient Royal Palace at Greenwich</span>
</div>

<p>Let us next consider what it means when the king is said
to have kept his Christmas at a place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span></p>

<p>During the festival&mdash;for twenty days&mdash;he kept open
house, nominally. That is to say, all comers received food
and drink: his guests, one supposes, were bidden. Every
day during the festival the king sat at the feast wearing his
crown and his robes of royal state. Richard II., the most
prodigal of all princes that ever lived, entertained every day
no fewer than ten thousand persons at his palace. What the
number was at Christmas no one knows. In addition to the
ordinary following of the court&mdash;a huge army of chaplains,
canons, scribes, secretaries, gentlemen archers, and servants&mdash;there
were the bishops and abbots, the peers and barons, who
came to the Christmas feast, each attended by his own following
of knights and esquires and men in livery. For the
entertainment of this enormous company what a huge establishment
would be needed! The organisation was complete;
everything was in departments, each under the yeomen: the
chambers, the wardrobe, the kitchens, the stables, the cellars.
Yet what an army in each department! Then, since at
Christmas time we look for amusement, there was the Master
of the Revels, and with him an extensive and variegated
following; among them were all those who played on the
different instruments of music, those who sang, the buffoons,
tumblers, and mummers, the dancing girls. It was in the
time of Henry III. that these performances were brought over
for the delectation of the English court&mdash;perhaps with the
pious intention of showing what joys and attractions awaited
the Crusaders in the Holy Land itself.</p>

<p>Hall's account of the festivities of a Christmas a hundred and
fifty years later than the time of Richard II. is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The Kyng this yere kept the feast of Christmas at
Grenewiche, wher was suche abundance of viands served to
all comers of any honest behaviour, as hath been few times
seen; and against New Yeres night was made, in the Hall,
a castle, gates, towers, and dungion, garnished with artilerie,
and weapon after the most warlike fashion: and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
frount of the castle was written, Le Fortresse Dangerus, and
within the castle were six ladies clothed in russet satin laide
all over with leves of golde, and every owde knit with laces
of blewe silke and golde; on ther heddes, coyfes and cappes
all of golde. After this castle had been carried about the
hal, and the Quene had behelde it, in came the Kyng with
five other appareled in coates, the one half of russet satyn,
spangled with spangles of fine golde, the other halfe riche
cloth of gold; on their heddes cappes of russet satin embroudered
with workes of fine gold bullion. These six
assaulted the castle: the ladies seyng them so lustie and
coragious were content to solace with them, and upon farther
communication to yeld the castle, and so thei came
down and daunced a long space. And after the ladies led
the knightes into the castle, and then the castle sodainly
vanished out of their sight.</p>

<p>'On the daie of the Epiphanie at night, the Kyng with
XI other were disguised after the manner of Italie, called a
maske, a thing not seen afore in Englande; they were
apparelled in garments long and brode, wrought all with
gold, with visers and cappes of gold; and after the banket
doen, these maskers came in with six gentlemen disguised
in silke, bearing staffe torches, and desired the ladies to
daunce; some were content, and some that knew the fashion
of it refused, because it was not a thing commonly seen. And
after they daunced and commoned together as the fashion of
the maske is, thei tooke their leave and departed. And so
did the Quene and all the ladies.'</p>

<p>When the Christmas festivities ceased, the servants packed
up the gear: the napery, plate, gold and silver cups, dishes,
pillows, curtains, tapestry and carpets. They were all laid
upon waggons, the broad-wheeled creaking waggons which
were dragged slowly over the uneven and heavy lanes by
teams of horses or by bullocks. The queen and her ladies
were carried in chairs or carriages, or went on horseback; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
king and his followers rode; and so they went back to
Westminster. The ferry carried over the heavy goods and
the horses: the royal barges received the court. After them
marched the whole rout&mdash;the two thousand archers without
whom Richard never moved; the armies of servants; lastly,
when the last procurable cup had been drained, the musicians
and the mummers and the singers marched off sadly. A
whole twelvemonth before another Christmas! They marched
in the direction of the City, and that night, as they report,
there was strange revelry in the inns of Southwark. The
house was left in charge of a warden, who had with him the
principal officers of the palace, the yeomen of the wardrobe,
of the cellars, of the kitchens, and so forth; the organisation
being kept up in readiness, though the king might not come
back for years. This fact was illustrated a short time ago,
when I was interested in watching the progress of a certain
genealogy. About the year 1540 a certain younger son left
his house; it was necessary to connect him with his own
descendants. The link was found in the fact that this younger
son had been received by Carey, warden of Hunsdon House,
who made him one of his yeomen; a cheerless appointment,
like a college in perpetual vacation, the warden and yeomen,
representing the Master and Fellows, dining every day in the
dismantled hall, and wandering about the empty courts and
silent gardens. Palaces, like theatres, have their times of
emptiness, during which it is best to keep out of them. For
my own part, I think the true way of enjoying a palace is to
frequent it as Froissart did: to hear all that was said and to
put down all that was done, but not to be an actor in a drama
which reeks of blood; not even the splendid mounting can
destroy that dreadful reek. How many people are murdered
about the court of England from Richard II. to Henry VII.?
Richard murders his uncle, Henry IV. murders his cousin,
Henry V. murders his uncle; Henry VI., it is true, murders
no one, but then he lives in a time when there is a perpetual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
series of murders. What an awful time! Froissart, who
looked on at part of the drama, achieved deathless renown for
his history, while in the whole of that court there was no one
whose head was safe on his shoulders except Froissart.
Unfortunately, he says little about this palace which we are
considering.</p>

<p>There are many names of kings and princes connected
with this house of Kennington. Edward I. was here occasionally.
During his reign it was the residence of John Earl
of Surrey, and of his son, John Plantagenet Earl of Warren
and Surrey. Plenty of histories could be made out of these
and other names, had the writer time or the reader patience.
In truth, the reader's patience is more to be considered than
the writer's time, for the writer, at least, has the joy of hunting
up names and notes and allusions, and of piecing together
what, after all, his reader may not find of interest enough to
carry him through. Edward III. made the manor part of the
Duchy of Cornwall. After the death of the Black Prince the
princess lived here with the young Prince Richard. I do not
find that Henry IV. was fond of a house which would certainly
be haunted&mdash;especially the room in which he was to sleep&mdash;by
the sorrowful shade of his murdered cousin. Nor did
Henry V. come here during his short reign. Henry VI.,
however, made use of Kennington Palace; so did Henry VII.;
and the last of the queens whose name can be connected with
the palace was Catherine of Arragon.</p>

<p>I do not know when the palace was destroyed. You have
seen the place as it was figured in 1636, when it was only an
ordinary square house. The plan was drawn when Charles I.
leased it to Sir Francis Cottington. The destruction of the
old house and the building of the new must have taken place
during the hundred years between 1530 and 1630. When
the new house was taken down I do not know.</p>

<p>The name that we especially associate with Kennington
Palace is that of Richard II. When the Black Prince died,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
in 1376, Richard remained at Kennington under the care of
his mother and the tutorship of Sir Guiscard d'Angle, 'that
accomplished knight.' The young prince started with the
finest possible chances of popularity. His father was not only
the greatest captain of his age, but he was also, in the latter
years of his life, on the popular side against the old King and
his supporters; the boy was endowed with a singular beauty
of person, and, when he pleased, with a sweetness of manner
most unusual even among princes, with whom affability is the
first essential in princely manners. In addition to this he was
destined to show on two occasions courage which almost
amounted to insensibility&mdash;first, when he dispersed Wat
Tyler's mob, and next, when he seized the reins of government.
History shows how he threw away all his chances in
reckless extravagance.</p>

<span class="caption">SEAL OF THE BLACK PRINCE

(From Allen&#39;s History of Lambeth)</span>
</div>

<p>After the death of the Black Prince it was resolved by the
Lord Mayor to pay a visit to Prince Richard at Kennington,
with a riding worthy of the City. The day chosen was the
Sunday before Candlemas (February 2). One has frequent
occasion to remark generally upon City pageants, that the
people in these processions and their pageants were entirely
regardless of winter cold or summer heat; they rode forth
upon a pageant as cheerfully in the cold of February as in the
sunshine of August. On this occasion, one hundred and
thirty-two citizens on horseback, with trumpets and other
musical instruments, and a vast number of <i>flambeaux</i>, assembled
at Newgate in the afternoon, and marched through
the City and over the bridge to Kennington Palace beyond
the Borough. First rode eight-and-forty men in the habits of
esquires&mdash;with red coats, say gowns, and vizards. Then followed
the same number apparelled as knights in the same
livery. Then rode one singly, a very majestic figure, who
represented the Pope, followed by his four-and-twenty cardinals.
They were followed by ten men dressed in black, with
black vizards, representing legates from the Pope of Hell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
This accounts for one hundred and thirty-two out of the whole
number. The last man is not described. To them must be
added pages and henchmen and whifflers, with men carrying
the presents. This cavalcade, which gave the greatest joy to
the citizens, all the way was followed by an enormous company
of 'prentices and craftsmen and children, crowding after
it and shouting. When it arrived at Kennington Palace they
all dismounted and entered the hall, where they found the
Princess of Wales, the young Prince, and their attendants,
together with the Duke of Lancaster and other great lords.
The court was first solemnly saluted by the masquers, who
then produced dice and invited the Prince to play with them.
Would you believe it?&mdash;every time the Prince threw, he won,
which was in itself a remarkable circumstance. He carried
off his winnings: a bowl of pure gold, chased and decorated;
a drinking cup also of gold, and a gold ring. They then
invited the Princess and the Duke of Lancaster and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
nobles present, each of whom also won and carried off a gold
ring. This done, the music played, and they were all invited
to supper in the hall with the Prince and the Princess his
mother. After supper, the tables were taken away&mdash;they were
only planks laid on trestles and covered with white cloths&mdash;and
the floor being cleared, the masquers had the honour of
dancing with the royal party. Finally, at a late hour, the
<i>flambeaux</i> were lighted, and the masquers rode home, well
pleased with the reception they had met and the courtesy of
the best behaved boy in the world.</p>

<p>In the same year occurred the great riot of London, which
arose out of Wyclyf's trial in St. Paul's and the quarrel between
the Bishop of London and John of Gaunt. The latter, after
the dismissal of Wyclyf, repaired to the house of John de
Ypres, close beside the river, where he was sitting at dinner
when one of his following ran hastily to warn him that the
people were flocking together with intent to murder him if
they could. The Duke therefore hastily ran down to the
nearest stairs, took a boat across the river, and fled as quickly
as possible to Kennington Palace, where he took shelter with
the young Prince Richard and his guardians. The mob,
finding that the Duke was gone, made their way to the Savoy,
his palace, threatening to burn and destroy all: they did
actually murder one poor priest because he resembled the
Duke in countenance; they were then persuaded by the
Bishop of London to go home without doing any more mischief.
What would have happened one knows not, but the
death of the old King gave an opportunity of patching up
the peace between the Duke of Lancaster and the citizens.
Hearing that Edward was <i>in extremis</i>, the Mayor and Aldermen
waited on the Princess of Wales and Prince Richard
informing them of the King's critical situation, and beseeching
the Prince's favour to the City; they also begged him to
interfere for the better accommodation of the Duke's differences
with them. It is pleasing to find that John of Gaunt freely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
forgave the City and became reconciled to the citizens; a
reconciliation which paved the way to the subsequent popularity
of his son Henry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span></p>

</div>

<p>It might be argued that the various impressions as regards
London produced on the mind of this prince explain his conduct
towards the citizens when he grew older. The first
experiment he had of the citizens was when they rode over in a
goodly company clad in red cloaks with gold chains and finely
appointed horses to visit him at Kennington: he remembered
that their appearance betokened great wealth; that they
tossed about gold cups as if they were of wood. This is a
kind of impression which does not easily die away.</p>

<p>His second impression of the City was when his uncle,
John of Gaunt, came flying from the City, having barely
escaped with his life, the people having gone on to wreck, if
they could, his palace of the Savoy. A turbulent and dangerous
people, then, as well as rich; a people to be kept down.</p>

<p>He next saw the City when he rode through it on his way
to be crowned at Westminster. All the way there was nothing
but rich tapestry, carpets, scarlet, cloth, masquers clad in velvet,
pageants with cloth of gold, and the streets filled with men
and women dressed in rich furs and silks, such as only great
barons could afford. This third impression confirmed the
first.</p>

<p>His next impression was that of the City lying prostrate
at the mercy of a large mob, unable to move or to help itself.
He went into the City almost alone; he, by one single act of
splendid courage, put an end to the insurrection. A City
cowardly, therefore, and unable to act together. It was his
City, moreover&mdash;the <i>Camera Regis</i>. Should not a prince do
what he pleases with his own?</p>

<p>When we read of his subsequent treatment of the City:
how he believed its treasures to be inexhaustible; how he believed
that it had no power to resist; how he made the way
easy for his cousin to supplant him, let us bear in mind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
lessons which the Londoners themselves provided for him in
his youth.</p>

<p>This King seizes on the imagination of all who think
about him. His is one of the strangest of all the strange figures
which crowd the National Portrait Gallery. Richly endowed
with artistic instincts; a lover of music and all the fine arts;
of singularly winning manners; the comeliest man in his
whole kingdom; splendid in raiment, magnificent in his
court, colossal in his personal pride, prodigal and extravagant
beyond compare; the King whom those who knew him in
his youth never ceased to love; for whose soul&mdash;not for the
soul of Henry IV.&mdash;Whittington, for instance, left money for
masses&mdash;this is a figure among our English kings which has
no parallel.</p>

<p>One more reminiscence of Kennington Palace. The last
occasion on which Richard lodged there was when he brought
home his little bride Isabel, the queen of eight years. They
brought her from Dover, resting on the way at Canterbury
and Rochester. At Blackheath they were met by the Mayor
and Aldermen, attired with great magnificence of costume to
do honour to the bride. After reverences due, they fell into
their place and rode on with the procession. When they
arrived at Newington, the King thanked the Mayor and permitted
him to leave the procession and return home. He
himself, with his company, rode by the cross-country lane
from Newington to Kennington Palace. I observe that this
proves the existence of a path or lane where is now Upper
Kennington Lane. At this palace the little queen rested a
night, and next day was carried in another procession to the
Tower. The knights rode before, and the French ladies came
after. It is pretty to read how Isabel, with her long fair hair
falling over her shoulders, and her sweet childish face, sat up
and smiled upon the people, playing and pretending to be
queen, which she had been practising ever since her betrothal.
Needless to say that all hearts were ravished. The good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
people of London were ever ready to welcome one princess
after another, and to lose their hearts to them, whether it was
Isabel of France, or Katharine her sister, or Anne Boleyn, or
Queen Charlotte, or the fair Princess of Denmark. So great
a press was there that many were actually squeezed to death
on London Bridge, where the houses only left twelve feet in
breadth. Isabel's queenship proved a pretence: before she
was old enough to be queen, indeed, her husband was in confinement;
before she understood that he was a captive, he
was murdered, and the splendid extravagant reign was over.
The son of the usurper, young Harry of Monmouth himself,
desired to take the place of Richard; his father also desired
the match, for the sake of the dowry. Isabel, child as she
was still, had the heart of a woman; she had learned to love
her handsome, courteous, accomplished lord, who died before
he could claim her; she refused absolutely to marry the son
of his murderer. They tried to move her resolution by persuasion;
they did not dare to force her: let us believe that
Harry of Monmouth would not stoop to force the girl to
marry him. There was nothing therefore left to do, but to
send her home to what was certainly the most miserable
court or palace in the world&mdash;that of her mad father. In the
end, she married her cousin, the poet Charles of Orleans.
You may read the verses which he made upon her death.
Isabel died in childbirth in her twenty-second year. As for
Harry of Monmouth, as all the world knows, he was obliged
to content himself with Isabel's younger sister, Katharine;
we have just read about that queen, and how she stooped to
a suitor below her own degree. I think she was made of clay
not so fine as that of Isabel, her sister.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span></p>


<h3>2. ELTHAM PALACE</h3>

<p>The second in our chain of suburban Palaces was the Royal
House of Eltham, already mentioned in connection with
Kennington. The place itself seems to have been a settlement
of some kind, a town or village, in very ancient times.
In the thirteenth century it was considered of importance
enough to receive the grant of a market day every Tuesday,
and a Fair for three days every year, namely, the day before
the Feast of the Trinity, the Feast itself, and the day after.
In the fourteenth century the market day was altered to
Monday, but the Fair remained; in the fifteenth century
the market day returned to Tuesday and the Fair was
changed to three days on the Eve of St. Peter and St. Paul,
on the Feast itself, and on the day after. The market and
the Fair have long since been discontinued. The importance
of both depended on the occasional presence of the Court,
and when that was removed altogether from the place there
was no longer any necessity for either market or Fair Day.
Eltham then became a small agricultural village lying in the
midst of woods, with nothing but scattered villages for many
miles round. So long as it contained one of the recognised
Palaces, even though years might pass by without a visit
from the sovereign, there was, attached to the house, the
permanent staff to a Governor or warder, with chiefs of the
various departments and the men or assistants under them.
The occupation of the Palace by such a staff gave the place a
kind of garrison, and created a demand for provisions and for
all sorts of things. On those rare occasions when the Court
was actually in Residence at Eltham, the market had to
furnish supplies, to which all the country round had to
contribute; nothing short of provisions for the maintenance
of thousands of people daily. At Eltham the difficulty may
have been very great; no doubt word would be sent long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
beforehand if the King proposed to keep Christmas there.
The yeomen of the kitchen had the beef put in the pickling
tubs in November&mdash;vast quantities of beef, for, Christmas or
not, the staple food of everybody in the winter was salt beef.
At the Palace of Kennington things were easier. It lay
within easy reach of the London market; so was Westminster.
Greenwich was accessible by ships from the lower
reaches of the Thames as well as from London. Eltham, no
doubt, depended upon the rich and fruitful country in which
it stood. At eight miles from London, the markets there
were of very little use. The annals of the Palace are simple,
rather than scanty; in fact, there is plenty of mention made
of the Palace, yet very little of importance is recorded concerning
it. All that is recorded of it belongs to peace and
festivity and the season of Christmas. Eltham was given by
William the Conqueror to his half-brother Odo, Bishop of
Bayeux and Earl of Kent. After the disgrace of Odo, and
the confiscation of his estates, the manor belonged partly to
the Queen and partly to the Mandevilles. Thence it passed
into the hands of the De Vesci family. From them it
went to the Scropes, and from them to various holders in
succession.</p>

<p>There was a Palace, or House, here of some kind in very
ancient times. The historian says that he cannot ascertain
when the Palace was built (see p. <a href="#Page_74">74</a>). Since the origin of
the House is unknown, he argues that it must have been
ancient. Now, concerning its connections with our Kings and
Queens, there is quite a long list. All these lists would have
to be catalogued, and even then be forgotten. For instance,
the following list of visits I borrow from Lysons. But I cannot
pretend that it is of much interest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 406px;"><a name="REMAINS_OF_ELTHAM_PALACE_1796" id="REMAINS_OF_ELTHAM_PALACE_1796"></a>

<span class="caption">REMAINS OF ELTHAM PALACE, 1796</span>
</div>

<p>In the year 1270 Henry III. kept Christmas at his Palace
of Eltham with the Queen and his nobles. After this the
name of Anthony Bec, Bishop of Durham and Patriarch of
Jerusalem, is connected with the place. He built a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
deal, but I know not if any ruins of his yet remain. He
died at Eltham in 1311, presumably in the Palace, for there
seem to have been no other buildings. Now we come back
to the kings, and we find historical associations in plenty,
though not of a kind which is moving or interesting. It does
not excite our curiosity much to learn that this king or that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
king kept Christmas here, and yet that is the kind of association
which I have to offer. Edward the Second was often here:
perhaps the seclusion of the place enabled him to play his
favourite games with his followers without being overseen.
One of his sons, John of Eltham, was born here. Edward
III., when still under age, had a Parliament at Eltham
in 1329. In 1347 his son Lionel kept Christmas for him at
Eltham. In 1364 he entertained here the French king John,
his prisoner. In 1375 he held another Parliament here,
when the Commons petitioned him to make Richard, his
grandson, Prince of Wales. Richard the Second, as we
should expect, regarded Eltham with a peculiar affection; it
was beautiful; the buildings were splendid. It was a long
way from the City which took upon itself to remonstrate with
his extravagance. Three times at least he kept Christmas
here: on the last he entertained Leo, King of Armenia, with
great splendour and profusion. Henry the Fourth kept
Christmas four times in the Palace. On the first, the Aldermen
of London and their children went down from the City
to perform a masque before the King, who received it well.
At that moment he was certain to receive everything well
that came from the City. On his last visit the disease broke
out which killed him. Henry the Fifth was here once, in
1414: Henry the Sixth once, in 1429. Edward the Fourth
was a second Founder, so much did he add to the buildings.
Among other things, he built a new front to the Palace and
is said to have built the Banqueting Hall itself. His festivities
rivalled those of Richard the Second. Here his
daughter Bridget, afterwards a nun of Dartford, was born.
Henry the Seventh was another builder: he stayed at Eltham
often. Henry the Eighth came here once at least, but he
preferred Greenwich as a residence as soon as that house
was built. Elizabeth also came here only once or twice, preferring
Greenwich, and James the First is only recorded to
have visited Eltham once. After this time Eltham ceased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
to be a Palace. In 1646 Robert Earl of Essex died here<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>;
the Manor was sold after Charles's death. After the Restoration
it reverted to the Crown; the rest of the history concerns
its occupancy by private families. On the death of Charles
the Palace was surveyed; it is described as being built of
brick, stone, and timber; it contained (see p. <a href="#Page_74">74</a>) one chapel, a
hall, 36 rooms and offices below stairs, with two large cellars;
and above stairs 17 lodging houses on the King's side, 12 on
the Queen's side, and 9 on the Prince's side; and 78 rooms
in the offices round the courtyard, which contained one acre
of ground: the house was out of repair and uninhabitable.
There were gardens attached to the house. A moat surrounded
the house, of width 60 feet, except in the forest, where it was
115 feet. The moat still exists on the north side, and can be
traced all round. Of the buildings little remains except the
old Banqueting Hall, a truly beautiful ruin; the roof, with its
fine woodwork, is happily still standing, but shored up and
supported. The windows are mostly blocked up; fragments
only remain of the other buildings; but it is said to be possible,
in the gardens at the back, to trace out the courts and the
foundations of the chapel and offices. The Palace is approached
by a bridge of about the same date as the Palace,
viz. the fourteenth century. It crosses the moat, and with its
picturesque ivy-clad arches and the Banqueting Hall on one
side, and the Court House on the other, it is as lovely an
approach to the ruin as could well be imagined or created.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span></p>

<p>One of the last visits of the King to Eltham was in the
year 1575, when Henry held one of the tournaments in which
in his early manhood he so much delighted. This is Holinshed's
account of it:&mdash;</p>

<p>'After the parlement was ended, the king kept a solemne
Christmasse at his manor of Eltham; and on the Twelfe
night in the hall was made a goodlie castell, woonderouslie
set out, and in it certeine ladies and knights; and when the
king and queene were set, in came other knights and assailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
the castell, where manie a good stripe was giuen; and at the
last the assailants were beaten awaie. And then issued out
knights and ladies out of the castell, which ladies were rich
and strangelie disguised; for all their apparell was in braids
of gold, fret with moouing spangls of siluer and gilt, set on
crimson sattin, loose and not fastned: the mens apparell of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
the same sute made like Iulis of Hungarie; and the ladies
heads and bodies were after the fashion of Amsterdam. And
when the dansing was doone, the banket was serued in of two
hundred dishes, with great plentie to euerie bodie.'</p>

<p>There is little more to be said about Eltham, which is a
place so beautiful that it ought to have a more interesting
history. Kings and Courts delight me not, nor do I take
pleasure in reading about tournaments and masques.</p>

<p>There is no figure in the history of Eltham so pleasant to
think upon as that of little Prince Richard, the lovely boy
who was going to become such an extravagant King. One
would like to have seen Edward entertaining his prisoner,
King John of France; and one wonders what sort of figure
was played by the Armenian Leo in the presence of Richard's
splendour: but perhaps he knew the Court of Constantinople,
and smiled at the splendour of the barbaric north.</p>

<p>Once more, how did they provide for the maintenance of so
many guests? To feed two thousand every day is a great
undertaking. We are accustomed to believe that the roads in
winter were so bad as to be impassable. Now, everything
had to be brought there, whatever the condition of the roads.
And they were bye-roads, not high roads. The guests, too,
and the nobles and their retainers, had to arrive by those roads.
As was stated above, due notice was certainly given: a vast
quantity of salt provisions was laid down in readiness:
for the rest, the country was fertile and well cultivated.
The Park contained deer&mdash;but they could not kill all; the
Thames, only three miles away&mdash;but then, the roads!&mdash;was full
of salmon and every kind of fish: the banks of the lower reaches
and those of the Ravensbourne&mdash;again, those roads!&mdash;were
the homes of myriads of wild birds. Still, one feels that the
inland communications of the fourteenth century must have
been a great deal better than those of the seventeenth century
in order to allow of Christmas being kept in magnificence and
profusion by two thousand people in a country village.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span></p>

<p>The views which accompany this account are taken from
Lysons: they were engraved in the year 1796. There is not
much difference in the present aspect: the moat has been
opened again: the buildings represented on the south side of
the Hall have vanished: and the place itself which had been
used as a barn is now empty, and is only thrown open for
visitors or the drilling of Volunteers.</p>

<h3>3. GREENWICH PALACE</h3>

<p>The Green Village lying on the slope of a gentle hill, with
marshes on either side of it&mdash;the marsh of the Ravensbourne
on one side, and the Woolwich or the Greenwich marsh on
the other side of it&mdash;is as old as history itself. Its position as
the landing-place, or point of approach, to the lands of Kent, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
place where ships might lie, pirates and invaders might seize
and hold as a base of operations, very early called attention to
its natural advantages. Here the Danes encamped in 1011;
here they brought the venerable Alphege and murdered him,
throwing beef bones at his head. As the throwing of bones
was a favourite evening pastime with the Danes, they probably
meant little at first beyond a friendly reminder or an invitation
to take part in the game: as the Archbishop made no
response they threw the bones in earnest (see p. <a href="#Page_72">72</a>). The
people of Greenwich have long since forgotten that the place
was once a Royal Residence, and that there are historical
memories connected with Greenwich of interest almost equal
to those of Westminster, and far more important and interesting
than those of Eltham.</p>

<p>Let us perform the perfunctory task of cataloguing some
of these memories.</p>

<p>In the year 1408, Henry IV. dates his will from Greenwich.</p>

<p>In 1417 Henry V. granted the manor for life to Thomas
Beaufort, Duke of Exeter, who afterwards died here.</p>

<p>In 1443 it was granted to Humphrey Duke of Gloucester,
with permission to fortify and embattle the manor house, and
to enclose a park of 200 acres. This was the true beginning
of Greenwich Palace. Humphrey rebuilt the house, which he
called Placentia, the House of Pleasance: he enclosed the
Park and he built a Tower on the spot where the Royal
Observatory now stands. On his death, in 1447, the place
reverted to the Crown. Edward the Fourth took great
pleasure in the place and beautified it at much cost. In 1466
he granted the Manor, Palace, and Park, to the Queen,
Elizabeth Woodville, for life. The marriage of Richard
Duke of York and Anne Mowbray was here solemnised with
the usual rejoicings.</p>

<p>With Henry VII. also Greenwich was a favourite place of
residence. He added a brick front on the riverside (see p. <a href="#Page_77">77</a>).
Here Henry the Eighth was born on June 28, 1491. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
baptised in the Parish Church, the predecessor of the present
church. He, too, loved Greenwich above all other Palaces,
and made it during the early years of his reign the scene of
the festivities and entertainments which he loved so much.
Here he married Katharine of Arragon on June 3, 1510.
Here he held the great tournament in which he himself, Sir
Edward Howard, Charles Brandon, and Edward Neville
challenged all comers. In 1512 and in 1513 he kept Christmas
here 'with great solemnity, dancing, disguisings, and mummers
in a most princely manner.' Holinshed gives an account of
two entertainments held by the King at Greenwich&mdash;one a
tournament in June, the other at Christmas:&mdash;</p>

<p>'This yeare also in Iune, the king kept a solemne iustes
at Greenewich, the king &amp; sir Charles Brandon taking vpon
them to abide all commers. First came the ladies all in
white and red silke, set vpon coursers trapped in the same
sute, freated ouer with gold; after whom followed a founteine
curiouslie made of russet sattin, with eight gargils spowting
water: within the founteine sat a knight armed at all peeces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
After this founteine followed a ladie all in blacke silke
dropped with fine siluer, on a courser trapped in the same.
Then followed a knight in a horsselitter, the coursers &amp; litter
apparelled in blacke with siluer drops. When the fountein
came to the tilt, the ladies rode round about, and so did the
founteine, and the knight within the litter. And after them
were brought twi goodlie coursers apparelled for the iusts:
and when they came to the tilts end, the two knights
mounted on the two courses abiding all commers. The king
was in the founteine, and sir Charles Brandon was in the
litter. Then suddenlie with great noise of trumpets entred
sir Thomas Kneuet in a castell of cole blacke, and ouer the
castell was written "The Dolorous Castell," and so he and the
earle of Essex, the lord Howard, and other ran their courses
with the king and sir Charles Brandon, and euer the king
brake most speares, and likelie was so to doo yer he began,
as in former time; the prise fell to his lot; so luckie was he
and fortunat in the proofe of his prowes in martiall actiuitie,
whereto from his yong yeers he was giuen....</p>

<p>'After this parlement was ended, the king kept a solemne
Christmasse at Greenwich, with danses and mummeries in
most princelie maner. And on the Twelfe daie at night
came into the hall a mount, called the rich mount. The
mount was set full of rich flowers of silke, and especiallie full
of broome slips full of cods, and branches were greene sattin,
and the flowers flat gold of damaske, which signified Plantagenet.
On the top stood a goodlie beacon giuing light,
round about the beacon sat the king and fiue other, all in
cotes and caps of right crimson veluet, embrodered with flat
gold of damaske, their cotes set full of spangles of gold.
And foure woodhouses drew the mount till it came before
the queene, and then the king and his companie descended
and dansed. Then suddenlie the mount opened, and out
came six ladies all in crimsin sattin and plunket, embrodered
with gold and pearle, with French hoods on their heads, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
they dansed alone. Then the lords of the mount tooke the
ladies and dansed togither: and the ladies reentered, and the
mount closed, and so was conueied out of the hall. Then
the king shifted him, and came to the queene, and sat at the
banket, which was verie sumptuous.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Other tournaments were held here in 1517, 1526, and
1536.</p>

<p>Here Charles Brandon married Mary, Dowager Queen of
France. Six or seven times more Henry kept Christmas
at Greenwich. In 1543, the last occasion, he entertained
twenty-one Scottish gentlemen, taken prisoners, and released
them without a ransom, being to the end, whatever else he
was, a Prince of most Princely gifts and graces.</p>

<p>Queen Mary was born at Greenwich in 1515. Cardinal
Wolsey was her godfather.</p>

<p>King Edward the Sixth died here.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth was born here on September 7, 1533.
She, too, spent much of her time at Greenwich.</p>

<p>King James also much delighted in this place: he
added to the brickwork by the riverside: he also walled the
park and laid the foundations of the house afterwards called
the House of Delight. The Queen, who received the Palace
in jointure, carried on this House, which was afterwards
completed by Inigo Jones for Henrietta Maria. It was
called the King's House, the Queen's House, or the Ranger's
Lodge. It was not until 1807 that the house was granted to
the Commissioners of the Royal Naval Asylum.</p>

<p>Separated from town by five miles of road, and four of
river, it was thus easily accessible in all weathers and independent
of the condition of the roads. In other respects
the position of the place was unrivalled: it was on a slope
rising from the river in front, and from lowlands on either
side; it was swept night and day by the sharp fresh breeze
that came up with the tide from the sea; behind it, on a high
level, lay an expanse of heath, dry and wholesome; there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
was no better air to be got than the air of Greenwich;
that of Eltham, with its stagnant marsh and thick woods, was
close and aguish in comparison: for view, the broad river
rolled along the Palace front and bent round to east and west,
so that one could see all the shipping in front; all in Limehouse
Reach; and all in Blackwall Reach. As the tide ebbed
and flowed, the navies and the trade of London passed up
and down, outward bound or homeward bound. Sitting at
her window, or walking on her terrace, Queen Elizabeth could
for herself learn what was meant by the foreign trade of
London: what was meant by the exports and imports: she
could see every kind of ship that floats come sailing up the
river, streamers flying, dipping the peak in salute: she could
understand the coasting trade and the Flemish trade: she could
ask what the hoys and ketches, the lighters, and the barges
carried up to the Port of London in such numbers: she could
herself, and often did, embark upon the stream in summer,
when the sun was sinking in the west, to see the ships more
closely and to enjoy the fresh, cool air of the river. Witness
the sad history of Thomas Appletree.</p>

<p>It was on the 17th day of July in the year 1579, about
nine o'clock of the evening, that an accident happened
which might have had fatal consequences. The Queen was
taking the air in her private barge, between Greenwich and
Deptford. With her were the French Ambassador, the Earl
of Lincoln, and other great persons, discoursing affairs of
state. Unfortunately for themselves, four young fellows were
out in a small boat at the same time, and on the same part of
the river. They were Thomas Appletree, a young servant of
Francis Carey, two singing boys of the Queen's choir, and
another. Thomas Appletree had possessed himself of a
'caliver' or arquebus, which he was so ill advised as to load
with ball and then fire it at random up and down the river.
One of these haphazard discharges carried the bullet straight
to the Queen's barge, where it passed through both arms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
the oarsman nearest Her Majesty. The man thus unexpectedly
wounded, finding himself bleeding like a pig&mdash;for
it was a flesh wound&mdash;threw himself down, bawling and
roaring out that he was murdered. The Queen comforted him
with the assurance that he should be properly cared for, and
ordered the barge to be taken back to the shore at once. The
man, being treated, speedily recovered. Meantime, who had
dared to fire a gun at the Queen's barge? The question was
very quickly answered, and the Lords in Council had the four
lads brought up before them. It appearing that the only
guilty person was Thomas Appletree, the other three were
suffered to depart, and Thomas was tried. It was ascertained
that there could be no question as to the loyalty of Thomas's
master, Francis Carey, therefore the whole guilt rested on the
shoulders of the unlucky serving man, whose only fault had
been foolhardiness in firing his gun at random. He was
therefore sentenced to be hanged, with the usual accompaniments,
for treason. Accordingly, on the 20th day of July he
was taken from Newgate and conducted on a hurdle with
great ceremony to Tower Hill, and so through the postern to
Ratcliff, where, opposite the place where the offence was
committed, they had put up a gibbet on which the unhappy
Thomas Appletree was to be hanged. He had made a
dolorous journey on his hurdle, weeping copiously all the way,
and many of the people weeping with him. Arrived at the
gallows, he mounted the ladder, and, if the chronicler repeats
faithfully, he made a most admirable use of the last moments
which remained to him. It is, indeed, truly remarkable to
observe how admirably all those who were taken out to die
acquitted themselves, whether it was a peer to be beheaded
for treason, or a Catholic priest to be hanged, drawn, and
quartered for being a priest. Appletree, for his part, spoke
so movingly that the people all wept with him. Then the
hangman put the rope round the condemned man's neck, and
the bitterness of death entered into his soul. But the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
cried, 'Stay! Stay!' and at that moment there came riding
up the Queen's Vice-Chamberlain, Sir Christopher Hatton.
But think not that the Vice-Chamberlain hastily proclaimed
the royal pardon. Not at all. He left Thomas on the ladder
for a while; he made an oration on the heinousness of the
offence: he made everybody kneel while he prayed for the
safety of the Queen: and then, when all hearts were softened
and all eyes bedewed, he pronounced the Queen's pardon,
which the prisoner acknowledged in suitable language.
Thomas Appletree was then taken back to the Marshalsea,
where he remained, one hopes, a very short time after this.
We may be quite sure that whatever destiny was in store for
this young man, shooting at random with a caliver or arquebus
would have nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>Another association of Greenwich is that of Sir John
Willoughby's departure for the Arctic seas. He was going
to endeavour to open a new way for trade round the N.E.
Arctic sea along the north coast of Asia. He embarked at
Ratcliff Stairs: you may take boat there to this day. As he
passed down the river, with flags and streamers flying, they
brought out the little King Edward, who was dying, to see
the sailing of the stout old sailor. So with firing of guns the
ships passed on their way, and they carried the dying King
back to his bed. In a day or two Edward was dead. In six
months, or it might be less, Willoughby was dead too, frozen
to death in his cabin, where the Russians found him, his dead
hand on his papers.</p>

<p>If you wish to know what state was kept by Queen
Elizabeth at Greenwich, you will find an account of it in
Hentzner, that excellent traveller who remarked so much,
and put all down on paper.</p>

<p>'We arrived at the Royal Palace of Greenwich, reported
to have been originally built by Humphrey, Duke of
Gloucester, and to have received very magnificent additions
from Henry VII. It was here Elizabeth, the present Queen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
was born, and here she generally resides; particularly in
Summer, for the Delightfulness of its Situation. We were
admitted by an Order Mr. Rogers had procured from the
Lord Chamberlain, into the Presence-Chamber, hung with
rich Tapestry, and the Floor, after the English fashion,
strewed with Hay,<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> through which the Queen commonly
passes in her way to chapel: At the Door stood a Gentleman
dressed in Velvet, with a Gold Chain, whose Office was to
introduce to the Queen any Person of Distinction, that came
to wait on her: It was Sunday, when there is usually the
greatest Attendance of Nobility. In the same Hall were the
Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of London, a great
Number of Counsellors of State, Officers of the Crown, and
Gentlemen, who waited the Queen's coming out; which she
did from her own Apartment, when it was Time to go to
Prayers, attended in the following Manner:</p>

<p>'First went Gentlemen, Barons, Earls, Knights of the
Garter, all richly dressed and bare-headed; next came the
Chancellor, bearing the Seals in a red-silk Purse, between
Two: One of which carried the Royal Scepter, the other the
Sword of State, in a red Scabbard, studded with golden
Fleurs de Lis, the Point upwards: Next came the Queen, in
the Sixty-fifth Year of her Age, as we were told, very majestic;
her Face oblong, fair, but wrinkled; her Eyes small, yet
black and pleasant; her Nose a little hooked; her Lips
narrow, and her Teeth black (a Defect the English seem
subject to, from their too great Use of Sugar): she had in
her Ears two Pearls, with very rich Drops; she wore false
Hair, and that red; upon her Head she had a small Crown,
reported to be made of some of the Gold of the celebrated
Lunebourg Table:<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Her Bosom was uncovered, as all the
English Ladies have it, till they marry; and she had on a
Necklace of exceeding fine Jewels; her Hands were small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
her Fingers long, and her Stature neither tall nor low; her
Air was stately, her Manner of Speaking mild and obliging.
That Day she was dressed in white Silk, bordered with Pearls
of the Size of Beans, and over it a Mantle of black Silk, shot
with Silver Threads; her Train was very long, the End of it
borne by a Marchioness; instead of a Chain, she had an
oblong Collar of Gold and Jewels. As she went along in all
this State and Magnificence, she spoke very graciously, first
to one, then to another, whether foreign Ministers, or those
who attended for different Reasons, in English, French and
Italian; for, besides being well skilled in Greek, Latin, and
the Languages I have mentioned, she is mistress of Spanish,
Scotch, and Dutch: Whoever speaks to her, it is kneeling;
now and then she raises some with her Hand. While we
were there, W. Slawata, a Bohemian Baron, had Letters to
present to her; and she, after pulling off her Glove, gave him
her right Hand to kiss, sparkling with Rings and Jewels,
a Mark of particular Favour: Where-ever she turned her
Face, as she was going along, everybody fell down on their
Knees.<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The Ladies of the Court followed next to her, very
handsome and well-shaped, and for the most Part dressed in
white; she was guarded on each Side by the Gentlemen
Pensioners, fifty in Number, with gilt Battleaxes. In the
Antichapel next the Hall where we were, Petitions were
presented to her, and she received them most graciously,
which occasioned the Acclamation of, Long live Queen
ELIZABETH! She answered with, I thank you, my good
PEOPLE. In the Chapel was excellent Music; as soon as
it and the Service was over, which scarce exceeded half an
hour, the Queen returned in the same State and Order, and
prepared to go to Dinner. But while she was still at Prayers,
we saw her Table set out with the following Solemnity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span></p>

<p>'A Gentleman entered the Room bearing a Rod, and
along with him another who had a Table-cloth, which, after
they had both kneeled three Times with the utmost Veneration,
he spread upon the Table, and after kneeling again they
both retired. Then came two others, one with the Rod
again, the other with a Salt-seller, a Plate and Bread; when
they had kneeled, as the others had done, and placed what
was brought upon the Table, they too retired with the same
Ceremonies performed by the first. At last came an unmarried
Lady (we were told she was a Countess), and along with
her a married one, bearing a Tasting-knife; the former was
dressed in white Silk, who, when she had prostrated herself three
Times, in the most graceful Manner, approached the Table,
and rubbed the Plates with Bread and Salt with as much
Awe as if the Queen had been present: When they had
waited there a little while, the Yeomen of the Guard entered,
bare-headed, cloathed in Scarlet, with a golden Rose upon
their Backs, bringing in at each Turn a Course of twenty-four
Dishes, served in plate, most of it Gilt; these Dishes were
received by a Gentleman in the same Order they were
brought, and placed upon the Table, while the Lady-taster
gave to each of the Guards a mouthful to eat, of the particular
dish he had brought, for Fear of any Poison. During the
Time that this Guard, which consists of the tallest and
stoutest Men that can be found in all England, being carefully
selected for this Service, were bringing Dinner, twelve
Trumpets and two Kettle-drums made the Hall ring for Half
an Hour together. At the end of this Ceremonial a Number
of unmarried Ladies appeared, who, with particular solemnity,
lifted the Meat off the Table, and conveyed it into the
Queen's inner and more private Chamber, where, after she
had chosen for herself, the rest goes to the Ladies of the
Court.</p>

<p>'The Queen dines and sups alone, with very few Attendants;
and it is very seldom that any Body, Foreigner or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
Native, is admitted at that Time, and then only at the
Intercession of somebody in Power.'</p>

<p>On the Restoration, Charles at first resolved to pull down
the Palace and build it anew. For this purpose he consulted
various persons, and after many delays began the
building. He only succeeded, however, in erecting what is
now the west wing of the Hospital. But it never again
became a Royal Residence. In 1694, the Palace was converted
into a Hospital for the Royal Navy. This splendid
institution, one of the glories of Great Britain, and a standing
monument of the nation's gratitude to her sailors, and an ever
present invitation to enter the navy, was closed, with that
stupid indifference to sentiment which so often distinguishes
the acts of our Government, in the year 1870.</p>

suffered his Courtiers to omit it.</p></div>


<h3>4. LAMBETH PALACE</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="Lambeth_Palace" id="Lambeth_Palace"></a>
<img src="images/illus_123.jpg" width="500" height="428" alt="Lambeth Palace" title="" />
<span class="caption">Lambeth Palace</span>
</div>

<p>The now
huge town of
Lambeth presents
few points of interest
either to the visitor
or to the historian.
There are no buildings of any
antiquity except the Palace and
the Church. There are no modern buildings at all worth
notice. There have been two or three memorable houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
which we shall do well to touch upon: but they are not so
memorable as to deserve long description. The Bishops of
Rochester had a house in the Marsh&mdash;the site is in Carlisle
Place, Westminster Road, at the back of St. Thomas's Hospital,
close to Lambeth Palace. It was in this house that, in 1531,
a wretched man named Robert Roose, in the Bishop's service
as cook, wilfully, as was alleged, poisoned a large number of
people, and was boiled to death in oil&mdash;the only instance, I
believe, of this dreadful punishment. The wretched man was
tied naked to a post and slowly lowered into the boiling fluid.
Fisher was the last Bishop of Rochester who lived in this
house. The buildings, with losses and additions, existed in some
form or other till 1827. The house, indeed, had a strangely
chequered history. The Bishop of Rochester exchanged it
with the Crown for a house thought more convenient in
Southwark, close to Winchester House. The Crown gave it
to the Bishop of Carlisle, who seems to have let it on lease:
thus it lost its ecclesiastical character altogether and became
given over to entirely secular uses. It was at one time a
pottery: then a tavern, and even a notorious and disorderly
house: then a dancing master taught his accomplishments in
the house: then it became a school. Finally, the gardens
were built over, the operations disclosing many interesting
gates and 'bits.'</p>

<p>Another house was that belonging to the Duke of Norfolk:
it was called Norfolk House, and it stood on the other side of
the Palace, on the site now marked by Paradise Street. Here
lived the old Duke whose life was saved by the death of
Henry the Eighth; here was brought up the accomplished
Earl of Surrey whose life would have been saved had Henry
died a few days earlier. Leland, the antiquary and scholar,
was the Earl's tutor. The widow of Dr. Parker, Archbishop
of Canterbury, obtained the house. Her heirs ceased to live
in it; the house was neglected, probably because no tenant
could be found for it. Finally, it was pulled down. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
interesting to note the town houses which stood upon the
Bank from Rotherhithe to Battersea: that of the Prior of
Lewes; of Sir John Fastolfe; of the Augustines; the House
of St. Mary Overies; Winchester House; Rochester House;
Norfolk House; and later, the house of the St. Johns at Battersea.
There are none between Bankside and Lambeth;
that part of the Embankment which lies between Blackfriars
and Westminster Bridge has no history and no associations.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="BONNER_HALL_LAMBETH" id="BONNER_HALL_LAMBETH"></a>
<img src="images/illus_125.jpg" width="500" height="392" alt="BONNER HALL, LAMBETH" title="" />
<span class="caption">BONNER HALL, LAMBETH</span>
</div>

<p>Another noteworthy Lambeth house was that called Copt
Hall, afterwards Vauxhall, situated opposite to the gardens
afterwards called Vauxhall. In this house the unfortunate
Arabella Stuart lived for a time. A good deal might be
written about Copt Hall, but not in this place.</p>

<p>The houses of the Archbishop, the Bishop of Rochester,
and the Duke of Norfolk stood close together and clustered
round the church. The reason was the necessity of building
on or near to the Embankment. Exactly opposite the south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
porch of the church may be observed a small and somewhat
decayed street grandly called the High. The name and the
situation close to the church indicate an individual and
separate existence of the town or village of Lambeth, of
which this was the principal street and the centre. The
village, in fact, did exist from very early times; its population
for the most part earned their livelihood as Thames fishermen.
They were the lineal successors of that fortunate Edric to
whom St. Peter appeared when he consecrated the Abbey.
There was another colony of Thames fishermen lower down
the river on Bermondsey Wall. When William the Conqueror
is said to have burned Southwark it was the fishermen's
cottages which he destroyed. None of these lived between
Bankside and Westminster, which is proved by the fact that
there is no church near the river wall at that place. The
Thames fishermen lingered on, though the fishery grew poorer,
until about 1820, when they were reduced to a single court in
Lambeth. The place is described as mean and rickety, with
neither paving nor lamps; the woodwork of the cottages
broken; the roofs burst and tottering; the windows stuffed
with rags or mended with paper; the children in rags; the
court a receptacle for everything.</p>

<p>Lambeth as it is has mostly sprung into existence in the
nineteenth century, during which its population has been
actually multiplied by ten, and more than ten, rising from
27,000 in 1801 to 295,000 in 1891, an enormous increase.
The principal reason of this development is the introduction
of a great many industries&mdash;potteries, vinegar factories, distilleries,
salt warehouses, bottle factories, and so forth.</p>

<p>Lambeth certainly cannot be called a beautiful town nor
a desirable place of residence. The perambulator looks about
in vain for streets noble, striking or picturesque; he looks in
vain for houses beautiful or ancient; there is nothing to
reward him. Old houses there were before the great increase
began, but they exist no more; the place is dull; in parts it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
is dirty; everywhere it is without character or distinction. It
has, however, a pretty park called after the famous Vauxhall
Gardens, on whose site it stands. The park is new, but it is
well laid out and planted; already it is a pretty piece of
greenery, and, with Kennington and Battersea Parks, offers a
much wanted breathing place for the multitudes of that
quarter. It is adorned, or enriched, or ennobled, by a statue
of Henry Fawcett, who died in a house on this spot. The
statesman, attired in a costume strictly of the period, is sitting
in a chair, pretending not to be aware that behind him stands
an angel with outstretched wings, crowning him with laurel.
He is obviously embarrassed by the situation. He feels that
he ought to be dressed in some kind of Court costume&mdash;if he
knew what&mdash;in order to receive the angel; or the angel might
have assumed a frock coat in compliment to the statesman.
The wings were probably in the way.</p>

<p>Lambeth Palace, whose history I am not going to narrate,
plays a very considerable part in the History of England.
In 1232 and in 1234, Parliament was held here. In 1261<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
and 1280 Councils were held here. In 1412 Archbishop
Arundell, the kindly Christian who was so anxious to
burn heretics, issued from this Palace a condemnation as
heretical of a great many opinions, insomuch that it became
obviously dangerous to have any opinions at all. This,
however, was the condition of mind most desired by the
Church of Arundell's time and of his views. It is needless to
recount the many occasions when Kings and Queens were
entertained at Lambeth Palace. Cardinal Pole died here. It
was sometimes a prison. Queen Elizabeth entrusted to the
care of the Archbishop at Lambeth, Bishops Tonstal and
Thirlby, the Earl of Essex, the Earl of Southampton, Lord
Stourton, and many others, who were kept in honourable confinement,
not in dungeons or cells, but each in his own
chamber.</p>

<p>That there were prisons in every Episcopal Palace was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
necessary at a time when the clergy could only be tried in
Ecclesiastical Courts, so that the Bishops could not send their
criminous clerks to an ordinary prison. Hence it is that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
frequently read of a priest brought before an Ecclesiastical
Court, but we do not learn what became of him. He was
consigned to the prison of the House. When the Lollards
inveighed against the corruption of ecclesiastics they accused
the Bishops of too great leniency towards their delinquents
and prisoners. In some cases, no doubt, the ecclesiastical
prison was used to save a prisoner from the worst consequences
of his offence. For instance, a heretic handed over
to the secular arm had by law to be burned. Let us endeavour
to believe that in the Archbishop's prison cells of Lambeth
there were many who might have been burned but for the
humanity which sometimes overrode even Ecclesiastical ruthlessness.</p>

<p>It is recorded in Archbishop Arundell's Register (Cave-Browne,
'Lambeth Palace,' p. 710) that he sent for a Chaplain
out of his prisons below his manor house at Lambeth. The
Chaplain was a preacher licensed by the Archbishop who yet
carried about with him a concubine. No doubt the poor man
regarded her as his wife, and so called her, as thousands of the
clergy did, and were held blameless by the people for so doing.</p>

<p>The Palace either contains, or has at some time contained,
the work of nearly every Archbishop in succession. For a
full and complete history of the buildings, which would be
outside the limits of the present chapter, the reader is referred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>

'Lambeth and its Associations.'</p>

</div>

<p>It is impossible to determine when the building of
Lambeth Palace began. One thing is certain, that it has
always been an Ecclesiastical Palace. The manor of Lambeth
belonged to the Lady Guda, sister of Edward the Confessor.
In Domesday Book the manor contained thirty-nine men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
who with their families probably represented a population of
about 200. They had a church, which stood on the site of
the present church. Observe how all the old churches
belonging to the Marsh stand on the Embankment&mdash;Rotherhithe;
St. Olave's; Lambeth; Battersea. Guda, wife
of Eustace, Count of Boulogne, gave the manor to the Bishop
and convent of Rochester, reserving the church. Harold, it
is said, took it from the Bishop; it was seized by William the
Conqueror. William Rufus restored it to Rochester and
added the patronage of the Church. In 1197 Hubert, Archbishop
of Canterbury, gave the manor of Dartford to the
Bishop and convent of Rochester, in exchange for Lambeth.
Having got possession of the place, Hubert set to work to
improve it. He obtained a weekly market and an annual
fair; the latter continued till the year 1757.</p>

<p>What Hubert built here is uncertain, but it is certain that
he did build some kind of residence. Stephen Langton added
other buildings; Boniface, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1260, found the buildings in great
need of repair or insufficient. He was the first considerable
builder of Lambeth. One may make a fair guess at the work
of Boniface. We may consider it by the light afforded by the
monastic Houses&mdash;this was not a monastery, but there was
certainly something of the monastic spirit about the House.
We may also take it for granted that certain essential parts
of the building, though they might be rebuilt with greater
splendour, would not change their position. For instance,
when in after years we find a chapel, a cloister, a water-tower,
or entrance from the river, and a gate-tower, or entrance
from the land&mdash;then these things existed from the first.
Boniface, therefore, found a chapel in the north-west corner
of the Palace, where it still stands; on the west side of the
chapel he found a water-tower with a gate opening upon a
creek of the river by which everything was received into the
House, the door of communication with the outer world,
while the Archbishop's barges and boats lay moored up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
creek. South of the chapel Boniface either built or rebuilt
the cloisters; south of the cloisters he built or rebuilt his
Hall. A Hall was absolutely necessary for a great house,
and for an Archbishop's Palace it must be a splendid Hall.
What is now called the Guard Room was probably at first
part of the Archbishop's private apartments.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 323px;"><a name="Doorway_in_the_Lollard39s_Tower" id="Doorway_in_the_Lollard39s_Tower"></a>
<img src="images/illus_133.jpg" width="323" height="550" alt="Doorway in the Lollard&#39;s Tower" title="" />
<span class="caption">Doorway in the Lollard&#39;s Tower</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span></p>

<p>A list of the rooms then in the Palace was made in 1321.
At that time there was the Archbishop's private Chapel, his
Chamber, his Hall, the Chancellor's Chambers, the Great
Chapel, the Great Gate, and certain minor apartments&mdash;a
modest list, but the dormitories and principal bedchambers are
not enumerated, nor is any mention made of the Library, the
offices, the cells, or the Main Gate, all of which must have
been there.</p>

<p>Then we come to the later works, of which there are more
than we need set down&mdash;are they not written in Ducarel the
Laborious and in Cave-Browne the Life-giver to the dust and
ashes of ancient facts? The principal gateway as we now see
it is the fifteenth century work of Cardinal Morton; it is built
in the same style as the gateway of St. John's College, Cambridge,
but is much larger and finer; with the Church, it forms
a most effective group of buildings. The present Water Tower
was built by Archbishop Chicheley, but on the site of an older
tower; it contained, as I have said, the water gate&mdash;that is to
say, the real gate of communication with the world. To this
gate came all the visitors&mdash;Kings and Cardinals, Legates,
Bishops and Ambassadors; and to this gate came the barges
with supplies for my Lord's table. Cranmer is said to have
built the small tower at the north-east of the Chapel. Cardinal
Pole, who died here, built the Long Gallery, and probably
the piazza that supported it. Laud built the smaller
tower on the south face of the Chicheley Tower. Let us remark
here that the Tower never had any connection with
Lollards, and that all the talk about the unhappy Lollard
prisoners is without foundation.</p>

<p>Juxon, who found the Palace a 'heap of ruins,' spent his
three years of occupancy and 15,000<i>l.</i> of his own money in restoring
the place for the honour and splendour of the Church.
As for what has been done since that time, especially by
Archbishop Howley, it all belongs to the detailed history of
the Palace. It is sufficient here to note that the Palace is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
worthy House to-day, as it was five hundred years ago, for
the residence of the Primate. He belongs still, as his Roman
Catholic predecessors, to a Church whose members love some
splendour in their ecclesiastical Princes, just as they love
splendour in their churches and stateliness in their ritual.
They do not desire to make a Bishop rich: they do desire
that a Bishop should not be hampered by narrow circumstances:
they desire that he should be able to take the lead
in all good works. In ancient times, the Bishop rode or sat
in splendid state: he sat every day at a table loaded with
costly and luxurious food: outwardly he was clothed with
silken robes. But he touched nothing that was set before
him: he lived hardly and abstemiously: and he wore next
his skin a hair shirt: and for greater self-denial he suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
his hair shirt to be full of vermin. That was the ideal
Bishop of mediæval times. Our own is much the same: a
simple life: a splendid house: modest wants: a large income:
for himself no luxuries: and an open hand. Such a
house: such an income: we have always given to an Archbishop,
whether of the old or of the Reformed Faith.</p>

<p>The Chapel has at least one memory which will always
cling to it. Within its dark and gloomy crypt Anne
Boleyn, brought from the Tower, stood to hear her sentence.
She was to be burned to death as an adulteress. I am not
qualified by study of the case or by education in the weighing
of evidence to pronounce an opinion as to her innocence. I
believe that those who have examined into the case are
of opinion that Anne Boleyn fell a victim to the King's
jealousy: to his change of mind towards her: and to her
own foolish frivolity. However, in the crypt she was persuaded
into making some sort of avowal of a previous betrothal, in
return for which she was spared the agonies of the stake. I
have sometimes thought that the King must have thought
her guilty, otherwise he would have divorced her on a charge
of adultery, and suffered her to live. If he did not believe
her guilty, how could he, being, above all things, a man of
human passions, have sentenced the woman whom he had once
loved to so horrible a death?</p>

<p>Let us note, however, that our ancestors did not regard
death by burning with quite the same horror as is now
common. There is a story of Rogers&mdash;or Bradford&mdash;the
martyr. Some one once begged his intercession to save a
woman from burning. 'It is a gentle mode of death,' he
replied. 'Then,' said the other, 'I hope that you yourself
will some day have your hands full of this gentle death.'
Punishment was meant to be painful: the least painful form
of death was that accorded to the noble&mdash;to be beheaded. If
a man died by the executioner, it was expected that he should
suffer. Death, in all forms, meant suffering. In disease and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
in old age men suffered torture as bad as any inflicted by
the executioner.</p>

<p>I am not excusing Henry. I am only pleading that he
must have believed in Anne's guilt or he could not possibly
have allowed such a sentence; and that cruel as it seems to
us, it did not seem so cruel at that time. There is, however,
no more sorrowful story in the whole long History of
England, which is, alas! so full of sorrow and of tragedy,
than that of Anne Boleyn.</p>

<p>Lambeth Palace, the only palace in the whole of South
London, is a monument of English History from the twelfth
century downwards. Kennington appears at intervals;
Eltham is a holiday house; Greenwich practically begins
with the Tudors. Lambeth, like Westminster or St. Paul's,
belongs to the long history of the English people. It is a
place little known: of the millions now, in the circle of the
Greater London, how many, I should like to ask, have ever
seen the interior? Of the vast population of Lambeth,
Battersea, and Kennington, of which it is the centre, how
many, I wonder, know anything at all about its history or its
buildings?</p>

<p>Of those who daily go up and down the river, who come
and go across the Bridge, and suffer their careless and unobservant
eyes to rest for a moment on the grey walls and
Tower of the Palace, how many are there who know, or
inquire, or care for the wealth of history that clings to every
stone?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span></p>

<br />
PAGEANTS AND RIDINGS</h2>


<p>The part which Processions of all kinds played in the
mediæval life is so great that one must inquire how Southwark
fared in this respect. Where Bishops, Abbots, and great
Lords lived there were Processions whenever one arrived or one
departed. If the Bishop of Winchester went to the King's
House at Winchester, it was with a great Procession of
followers, chaplains, priests, secretaries, and gentlemen. If
the Earl of Suffolk arrived at his town house, it was with a gallant
company of gentlemen wearing his livery. If the King
kept his Christmas at Eltham, he would be preceded by an endless
train of carts groaning and grumbling along the road, filled
with household gear and followed by the troops of scullions,
cooks, grooms and lavenders whose duty was in the kitchens,
stables, laundries, and pantries. He himself rode with a royal
regiment, sometimes 4,000 strong, of archers for his bodyguard,
besides the nobles, Bishops and Abbots who were with
him for the Christmas festivities. The town itself had its Processions:
the annual march of the Fraternity to church: the
departure and the arrival of the pilgrims; the Ecclesiastical
Functions of Church and Monastic House. As for the royal
pageants and the Lord Mayor's Ridings, it must be confessed
that Southwark got but the beginning: that part of the
pageant which began at London Bridge: and that the place
itself was quite passed by and unconsidered.</p>

<p>Since, however, Southwark did witness that part, I have
drawn up a short series of notes on the sights of which the
Borough took a share.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, when Richard the Second restored the City privileges
in 1392, he was met by four hundred of the citizens, all
mounted and clad in the same livery: they invited him to
ride to Westminster through London.</p>

<p>'The request having been granted, he pursued his journey
to Southwark, where, at St. George's Church, he was met by
a procession of the Bishop of London and all the religious of
every degree and both sexes, and about five hundred boys in
surplices. At London Bridge a beautiful white steed and
a milk-white palfrey, both saddled, bridled, and caparisoned
in cloth of gold, were presented to the King and Queen. The
citizens received them, standing in their liveries on each side
the street, crying, "King Richard, King Richard!"'</p>

<p>The rest of the pageant belongs to the City and to North
London. Again, on the return of the victorious Henry the
Fifth from France there was a splendid Pageant, of which
the South got some part, namely, the following:</p>

<p>'On the King's return after the glorious field of Agincourt,
the Mayor of London and the Aldermen, apparelled in orient
grained scarlet, and four hundred commoners clad in beautiful
murrey, well mounted and trimly horsed, with rich collars and
great chains, met the King at Blackheath; and the clergy of
London in solemn procession, with rich crosses, sumptuous
copes, and massy censers, received him at St. Thomas of
Waterings. The King, like a grave and sober personage,
and as one who remembered from Whom all victories are
sent, seemed little to regard the vain pomp and shows, insomuch
that he would not suffer his helmet to be carried with
him, whereby the blows and dents upon it might have been
seen by the people, nor would he suffer any ditties to be
made and sung by minstrels of his glorious victory, because
he would the praise and thanks should be altogether given to
God.</p>

<p>'At the entrance of London Bridge, on the top of the
tower, stood a gigantic figure, bearing in his right hand an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
axe, and in his left the keys of the City hanging to a staff, as
if he had been the porter. By his side stood a female of
scarcely less stature, intended for his wife. Around them were
a band of trumpets and other wind instruments. The towers
were adorned with banners of the royal arms, and in the front
of them was inscribed <span class="smcap lowercase">CIVITAS REGIS JUSTICIE</span> (the City of
the King of Righteousness).</p>

<p>'At the drawbridge on each side was erected a lofty
column like a little tower, built of wood and covered with
linen; one painted like white marble, and the other like
green jasper. They were surmounted by figures of the King's
beasts&mdash;an antelope, having a shield of the royal arms suspended
from his neck, and a sceptre in his right foot; and a
lion, bearing in his right claw the royal standard unfurled.</p>

<p>'At the foot of the bridge next the city was raised a
tower, formed and painted like the columns before mentioned,
in the middle of which, under a splendid pavilion, stood
a most beautiful image of St. George, armed, excepting his
head, which was adorned with a laurel crown studded with
gems and precious stones. Behind him was a crimson tapestry,
with his arms (a red cross) glittering on a multitude of
shields. On his right hung his triumphal helmet, and on his
left a shield of his arms of suitable size. In his right hand he
held the hilt of the sword with which he was girt, and in his
left a scroll, which, extending along the turrets, contained
these words, <span class="smcap lowercase">SOLI DEO HONOR ET GLORIA</span>. In a contiguous
house were innumerable boys representing the angelic host,
arrayed in white, with glittering wings, and their hair set with
sprigs of laurel; who, on the King's approach, sang, accompanied
by organs, an anthem, supposed to be that beginning
"Our King went forth to Normandy;" and whose burthen is
"Deo gratias, Anglia, redde pro victoria."'</p>

<p>When Henry VI. returned after his coronation in 1432&mdash;</p>

<p>'On returning from his Coronation in France King Henry
the Sixth was met at Blackheath by the Mayor and citizens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
of London, on Feb. 21, 1431-2; the latter being dressed in
white, with the cognizances of their mysteries or crafts embroidered
on their sleeves; and the Mayor and his brethren
in scarlet.</p>

<p>'When the King came to London Bridge, there was devised
a mighty giant, standing with a sword drawn, and
having this poetical speech inscribed by his side:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'All those that be enemies to the King,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I shall them clothe with confusion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make him mighty by virtuous living,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His mortal foes to oppress and bear them down:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And him to increase as Christ's champion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All mischiefs from him to abridge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With grace of God, at the entry of this Bridge.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'When the King had passed the first gate, and was arrived
at the drawbridge, he found a goodly tower hung with
silk and cloth of arras, out of which suddenly appeared three
ladies, clad in gold and silk, with coronets upon their heads;
of which the first was dame Nature, the second dame Grace,
and the third dame Fortune. They each addressed the King
in verses similar to those already quoted, and which, together
with those which followed, the curious will find in their
place. On each side of them were ranged seven virgins,
all clothed in white; those on the right hand had baudricks
of sapphire colour or blue, and the others had their garments
powdered with golden stars. The first seven presented the
King with the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost&mdash;sapience, intelligence,
good counsel, strength, cunning, pity, and dread of God:
and the others with the seven gifts of grace, in these verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'God thee endow with a crown of glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the sceptre of clemency and pity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a sword of might and victory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a mantle of prudence clad thou be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shield of faith for to defend thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A helm of health wrought to thine increase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Girt with a girdle of love and perfect peace.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span></div></div>

<p>'After which they sang a roundel, the burthen of which
was "Welcome out of France."'</p>

<p>The Pageant which welcomed Queen Margaret of Anjou
on her Coronation presented, first, at the Bridge Foot at Southwark,
'Peace and plenty,' with the motto 'Ingredimini et
replete terram,'&mdash;Enter ye and replenish the earth&mdash;and the
following verses were recited:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Most Christian Princesse, by influence of grace,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Upon the Bridge itself appeared Noah's Ark, with the
words, 'Jam non ultra irascar super terram' (Genesis viii. 21),
and the following verses were addressed to the Queen:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>On the marriage of Katharine of Aragon with Prince
Arthur there was a great Pageant. The part at the south
entrance of the Bridge is thus described:</p>

<p>'It consisted of a tabernacle of two floors, resembling two
roodlofts; in the lower of which sat a fair young lady with a
wheel in her hand, in likeness of Saint Katherine, with many
virgins on every side of her; and in the higher story was
another lady, in likeness of Saint Ursula, also with a great
multitude of virgins right goodly dressed and arrayed. Above
all was a representation of the Trinity. On each side of both
stories was one small square tabernacle, with proper vanes,
and in every square was a garter with this poesy in French,
<i>Onye soit que male pens</i>, inclosing a red rose. On the tops
of these tabernacles were six angels, casting incense on the
Trinity, and the two Saints. The outer walls were painted
with hanging curtains of cloth of tissue, blue and red; and
at some distance before the pageant were set two great posts,
painted with the three ostrich feathers, red roses, and portcullisses,
and surmounted by a lion rampant, holding a vane
painted with the arms of England. The whole work was
carved with timber, and was gilt and painted with biss and
azure.'</p>

<p>The next Pageant that passed through Southwark was
that of Charles the Second at his Restoration:</p>

<p>'On the 29th of May, 1660, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen
met the King at St. George's Fields in Southwark, and
the former, having delivered the City sword to his Majesty,
had the same returned with the honour of knighthood. A very
magnificent tent was erected in the Fields, provided with a
sumptuous collation, of which the King participated. He
then proceeded towards London, which was pompously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
adorned with the richest silks and tapestry, and the streets
lined with the City Corporations and trained bands; while
the conduits flowed with a variety of delicious wines, and the
windows, balconies, and scaffolds were crowded with such an
infinite number of spectators, as if the whole collective body
of the people had been assembled to grace the Royal Entry.</p>

<p>'The procession was chiefly composed of the military.
First marched a gallant troop of gentlemen in cloth of silver,
brandishing their swords, and led by Major-General Brown;
then another troop of two hundred in velvet coats, with footmen
and liveries attending them, in purple; a third led by
Alderman Robinson, in buff coats with cloth of silver sleeves
and very rich green scarfs; a troop of about two hundred,
with blue liveries laid with silver, with six trumpeters, and
several footmen, in sea-green and silver; another of two
hundred and twenty, with thirty footmen in grey and silver
liveries, and four trumpeters richly habited; another of an
hundred and five, with grey liveries, and six trumpets; and
another of seventy, with five trumpets; and then three troops
more, two of three hundred and one of one hundred, all
gloriously habited, and gallantly mounted. After these came
two trumpets with his Majesty's arms; the Sheriffs' men,
in number fourscore, in red cloaks, richly laced with silver,
with half-pikes in their hands. Then followed six hundred
of the several Companies of London on horseback, in black
velvet coats, with gold chains, each Company having footmen
in different liveries, with streamers, &amp;c.; after whom came
kettle-drums and trumpets, with streamers, and after them
twelve ministers (clergymen) at the head of his Majesty's
life-guard of horse, commanded by Lord Gerrard. Next the
City Marshal, with eight footmen in various colours, with the
City Waits and Officers in order; then the two Sheriffs with
all the Aldermen in their scarlet gowns and rich trappings,
with footmen in liveries, red coats laid with silver, and cloth
of gold; the heralds and maces in rich coats; the Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
Mayor bare-headed, carrying the sword, with his Excellency
the General (Monk) and the Duke of Buckingham, also uncovered;
and then, as the lustre to all this splendid triumph,
rode the King himself between his Royal brothers the Dukes
of York and Gloucester. Then followed a troop of horse
with white colours; the General's life-guard, led by Sir
Philip Howard, and another troop of gentry; and, last of all,
five regiments of horse belonging to the army, with back,
breast, and head-pieces: which, it is remarked, "diversified
the show with delight and terror."'</p>

<p>On November 26, 1697, after the Peace of Ryswick,
William the Third made a triumphant entry into London:</p>

<p>'He came from Greenwich about ten o'clock, in his coach,
with Prince George and the Earl of Scarbrough, attended by
four score other coaches, each drawn by six horses. The
Archbishop of Canterbury came next to the King, the Lord
Chancellor after him, then the Dukes of Norfolk, Devon,
Southampton, Grafton, Shrewsbury, and all the principal
noblemen. Some companies of Foot Grenadiers went before,
the Horse Grenadiers followed, as did the Horse Life-Guards
and some of the Earl of Oxford's Horse; the Gentlemen of
the Band of Pensioners were in Southwark, but did not march
on foot; the Yeomen of the Guard were about the King's
coach.</p>

<p>'On St. Margaret's Hill in Southwark the Lord Mayor
met his Majesty, where, on his knees, he delivered the sword,
which his Majesty returned, ordering him to carry it before
him. Then Mr. Recorder made a speech suitable to the
occasion, after which the cavalcade commenced.</p>

<p>'A detachment of about one hundred of the City Trained
Bands, in buff coats and red feathers in their hats, preceded;
then followed two of the King's coaches, and one of Prince
George's; then two City Marshals on horseback, with their
six men on foot in new liveries; the six City Trumpets on
horseback; the Sheriff's Officers on foot with their halberds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
and javelins in their hands; the Lord Mayor's Officers in
black gowns; the City Officers on horseback, each attended
by a servant on foot, viz.: the four Attorneys, the Solicitor
and Remembrancer, the two Secondaries, the Comptroller,
the Common Pleaders, the two Judges, the Town Clerk, the
Common Serjeant, and the Chamberlain. Then came the
Water Bailiff on horseback, carrying the City banner; the
Common Crier and the Sword-bearer, the last in his gown of
black damask and gold chain; each with a servant; then
those who had fined for Sheriffs or Aldermen, or had served
as such, according to their seniority, in scarlet, two and two,
on horseback; the two Sheriffs on horseback, with their gold
chains and white staffs, with two servants apiece; the Aldermen
below the chair on horseback, in scarlet, each attended
by his Beadle and two servants; the Recorder, in scarlet, on
horseback, with two servants; and the Aldermen above the
chair, in scarlet, on horseback, wearing their gold chains, each
attended by his Beadle and four servants. Then followed
the State all on horseback, uncovered, viz.: the Knight
Marshall with a footman on each side; then the kettle-drums,
the Drum-Major, the King's Trumpets, the Serjeant Trumpet
with his mace; after followed the Pursuivants at Arms,
Heralds of Arms, Kings of Arms, with the Serjeants at Arms
on each side, bearing their maces, all bare-headed, and each
attended with a servant. Then the Lord Mayor of London
on horseback, in a crimson velvet gown, with a collar and
jewel, bearing the City sword by his Majesty's permission,
with four footmen in liveries; Clarenceux King at Arms
supplying the place of Garter King at Arms on his right
hand, and one of the Gentleman Ushers supplying the place
of the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod on his left hand,
each with two servants. Then came his Majesty in a rich
coach, followed by a strong party of Horseguards; and the
Nobility, Judges, &amp;c., according to their ranks and qualities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
there being between two and three hundred coaches, each
with six horses.'</p>

<p>On September 20, 1714, George the First was received by
the Mayor and Corporation at St. Margaret's Hill, Southwark,
with much the same state as that of William III. seventeen
years before.</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor's Pageants, of which there were so many,
had nothing to do with Southwark at all, except when they
were water processions, in which case they could be seen as
well from the South as from the North. But, in fact, Southwark
was wholly disregarded in all these Pageants. The
sovereign rode through the City, not through Southwark.
Why should the place be regarded at all? Practically, as has
been shown over and over again, it consisted of nothing at all
but a causeway and an embankment, and what was once a
broad Marsh drained and divided into fields and gardens and
woods.</p>

<p>I have set down what royal processions Southwark was
permitted to see, but I do not suppose that among the four
hundred citizens who went out in one livery to meet King
Richard there was one man from Southwark, nor do I
suppose that when nine hundred and sixty citizens, each man
carrying a silver cup, rode through London with the Coronation
procession, there was a single man from the quarter
south of London Bridge. In other words, although in course
of time there was appointed&mdash;never elected&mdash;an Alderman of
the Bridge Without, at no time in these Pageants or in these
functions was Southwark ever regarded as part of the City, nor
were her wishes consulted or her interests considered.</p>

<p>One Pageant alone&mdash;that of our own time&mdash;the splendid
Pageant of 1897, reversed this position. As is well known,
the Procession which celebrated the Sixty Years' Reign
passed through the Borough as well as the City.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span></p>



<hr style='margin-left:17.5%; width:65%'/>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI
<br />
<br />
A FORGOTTEN WORTHY</h2>


<p>I have to speak of a 'worthy' of Southwark who is only
now remembered by the curious as the alleged original of
Sir John Falstaff. If Shakespeare drew his incomparable
knight from a portrait of Sir John Fastolf, then one can only
say that the portrait in no single particular resembled the
original. Sir John Fastolf was a great and, on the whole, a
successful soldier who spent forty years fighting and commanding
in France. Shakespeare's knight was unwarlike,
even cowardly; fat: a frequenter of taverns and of low
company, with no dignity and no authority. The only point
that may lend colour to the theory that Fastolf was Falstaff
lies in the fact that Fastolf was accused of cowardice at a
certain battle, one of the many which he fought: and that on
his return from France, the English, exasperated at their
losses, laid the blame as they always do upon their most
distinguished soldiers. Fastolf was as unpopular in his old
age as any defeated general: there is no unpopularity so
great: yet Fastolf was never a defeated general.</p>

<p>Shakespeare knew no more about Fastolf than the traditional
charge of cowardice. In the First Part of 'Henry VI.'
he presents him running away:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
<i>Captain.</i> Whither away, Sir John Fastolfe, in haste?<br />
<br />
<i>Fast.</i> Whither away? To save myself by flight.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">We are like to have the overthrow again.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Captain.</i> What? Will you fly and leave Lord Talbot?<br />
<br />
<i>Fast.</i>        Ay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">All Talbots in the world to save my life.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span></p>

<p>And again in Act IV. Talbot denounces Fastolf:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
This dastard, at the Battle of Patay,<br />
When but in all I was six thousand strong,<br />
And that the French were almost ten to one,<br />
Before we met, or that a stroke was given,<br />
Like to a trusty knight, did run away.<br />
</p>

<p>And he tears off the Garter which Sir John was wearing.</p>

<p>Sir John Fastolf came of a Norfolk family; his people
held the manors of Caister and Rudham. He was born in
the year 1378, and became, after the fashion of the times,
first a page to the Duke of Norfolk and next to Thomas
of Lancaster, Henry the Fourth's second son.</p>

<p>Caxton says that he 'exercised the wars in the royaume
of France and other countries by forty yeares enduring.' If
so he must have been fighting in France or elsewhere across
the seas as early as 1400. Perhaps he went over earlier. He
was, at least, successful in getting promotion, and promotion
in a time of continuous war cannot be bestowed on a soldier
incapable or cowardly. He became Governor of Veires in
Germany and of Harfleur. He fought with distinction at
Agincourt: at the taking of Caen and at the siege of Rouen:
he was Governor of Condé-sur-Noireau and of other places,
as they were taken. We find him, for instance, the Governor
of the Bastille in Paris. When Henry V. died, in 1422, he
became Master of the Household to the Duke of Bedford,
Regent of France. He was Lieutenant-Governor of Normandy
and Governor of Anjou and Maine. It is remarkable to
observe that in spite of his great services he was not knighted
until 1417, when he was already forty years of age. In 1426,
he was made a Knight of the Garter. In 1429, he won the
day at the 'Battle of the Herrings,' when with a small company
of archers he put to flight an army.</p>

<p>His record does not lead one to expect a charge of
cowardice. Yet the charge was brought. It was after the
Battle of Patay, in which Talbot was taken prisoner and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
English totally defeated. The reverse was attributed by
Talbot to the cowardly defection of Fastolf, rather than to
his own incompetence. Fastolf demanded an investigation,
which was made, with the result of his acquittal. Probably
Lord Talbot persisted in his explanation of defeat. The age,
it must be confessed, was not exactly chivalrous. The Wars
of the Roses, which were about to begin, brought to light
gallant knights without truth or fidelity: perjured princes as
well as perjured barons: accusations and recriminations:
shameless desertions and changes of front. An evil time. If
Lord Talbot simply tried to shift the blame of his own defeat
upon Fastolf, it would be what other noble lords were perfectly
ready to do in their anxiety to escape responsibility in
the loss of France: a disaster, as it was then thought, which
brought the greatest humiliation on the people. As for
Fastolf, he continued to receive posts of honour and distinction.
Yet the common people heard the reports brought
home by the soldiers: nothing is more easy than a charge
of treachery and cowardice: they knew nothing of the
acquittal. To them Fastolf became in common talk the
coward who single-handed lost France by always running
away.</p>

<p>After the Battle of Patay, Fastolfe became Governor of
Caen: he raised the siege of Vaudmont: took prisoner the
Duc de Bar: he was twice appointed ambassador: he fought
in the army of the Duc de Bretagne against the Duc
d'Alençon: and he was ordered to draw up a report of
the war. All this does not show much confidence in Lord
Talbot's accusation.</p>

<p>In 1440, then sixty-two years of age, he sheathed his
sword, put off his armour and returned to England. Few
men could show a longer, or a finer, record of war. In 1441
he received from the Duke of York an annuity of £20 a year,
'pro notabili et laudabili servicio ac bono consilio.' He spent
the rest of his life partly in his house at Southwark and partly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
in his castle of Caister, which he built himself: we may very
well understand that he was a man of great wealth when we
read that the castle covered five acres of land.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span></p>

<img src="images/illus_151.jpg" width="355" height="550" alt="WHITE HART INN, SOUTHWARK" title="" />
<span class="caption">WHITE HART INN, SOUTHWARK</span>
</div>

<p>These are the achievements of the man. About his
private life and character we have a great fund of information
in the 'Paston Letters.' His latest biographer ('S. L. L.'
in the 'Dictionary of National Biography') concludes from
these letters that Fastolf was a 'grasping man of business:'
that he spent his old age in 'amassing wealth:' that he was
a testy neighbour: that his dependents had much to endure
at his hands. All these things may certainly be inferred from
the letters. At the same time we must consider, apart from
the letters, the manners of the age and the conditions of the
age.</p>

<p>Let us take the charges one by one.</p>

<p>First, that his dependents had much to endure from
him.</p>

<p>It was not a time when dependents spent their time as
they pleased. In a well-ordered household every man had
his post and his work. An old Knight who had fought for
forty years and commanded armies was not at all likely to be
a master of a soft and indulgent kind. There is no greater disciplinarian
than the old soldier: no household is more sternly
ruled than his. This man had not only commanded armies,
he had governed provinces, cities, castles: he had wielded
despotic authority: he had found it necessary to master
every branch of human activity, including the law and the
chicanery of lawyers: as the general in command or the
Governor of the Province considered the interests of his
master the King before everything, so Fastolf expected his
dependents to consider his interests as before everything else.
The stern old Captain, I can very well believe, looked to
every one of his dependents for his share of work, and I can
also very well believe that they feared him as the masterful
man is always feared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span></p>

<p>One of these dependents calls him 'cruel and vengeful.'
But he gives no reasons.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 478px;"><a name="SURREY_END_OF_LONDON_BRIDGE" id="SURREY_END_OF_LONDON_BRIDGE"></a>
<img src="images/illus_153.jpg" width="478" height="550" alt="SURREY END OF LONDON BRIDGE, FROM HIGH STREET, SOUTHWARK" title="" />
<span class="caption">SURREY END OF LONDON BRIDGE, FROM HIGH STREET, SOUTHWARK</span>
</div>

<p>One does not carry on war for forty years in the midst of
spies, traitors, robbers, and all the villainy of a camp without
becoming stern and hard. As a soldier he had to harden
himself: as a governor he had to observe justice rather than
pity: as a judge it was his duty to punish criminals. I
picture a stern, determined man, grey and worn, with hard
eyes and strong mouth, one who looked for a thing to be
done as soon as he commanded it, at the coming of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
his servants became instantly absorbed in work, at whose
footstep his secretaries dared not lift their heads.</p>

<p>Next we are told that he was a 'testy neighbour.' The
letters are full of complaints about trespass, invasion of his
rights, and attempts to over-reach him. How could a man
choose but prove a 'testy neighbour' at a time when the
law was powerless and every man was trying to enlarge his
boundaries at the expense of his next neighbour? The land
robber was everywhere moving landmarks and claiming what
was not his own. Private persons, simple esquires, had to
fortify their houses against their neighbours and to prepare for
a siege. 'I pray you,' says Margaret Paston, 'to get some
crossebows and wyndace to bind them with, and quarrel'&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
bolts&mdash;'for your house is so low that ther may no man
shoot with no long bow though he had never so much mind.'
And she goes on to enumerate the warlike preparations made
by her neighbour.</p>

<p>Sir John Fastolf himself orders five dozen long bows, and
quarrels for his own house in Norfolk. John Paston complains
how Robert Hungerford, Knight, and Lord Moleyne and
Alianor his wife, entered forcibly upon his house and manor
of Gresham with a thousand people at their heels, and robbed
and pillaged, turning his wife and servants into the road.</p>

<p>These are things which do sometimes make neighbours
testy.</p>

<p>But he is a 'grasping man of business.'</p>

<p>Hear, then, this story. The Duke of Suffolk seizes upon
property belonging to Fastolf. The judges are bribed and
justice cannot be had. Sir John and his friend, Mr. Justice
Yelverton, resolve to address the Duke of Norfolk, and
to let him know that the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk
'do stand right wildly. Without a mun may be that justice
be hadde.' Is it a surprising thing that an old soldier should
resolve to get justice if possible? Is it right to call a man
'grasping' because he stands up in his own defence? Read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
again the following. 'I pray you sende me worde who darre
be so hardy to kick agen you in my ryght. And sey hem on
my half that they shall be givyt as ferre as law and reson
wolle. And yff they wolle not dredde, ne obey that, then
they shall be quyt by Blackberd or Whiteberd: that ys to say
by God or the Devyll. And therefor I charge you, send me
word whethyr such as hafe be myne adversaries before thys
tyme, contynew still yn their wylfullnesse.' I see nothing
unworthy or grasping in this letter: only a plain soldier's
resolve to get justice or he would know the reason why.</p>

<p>It is further objected that he had long-standing claims
against the Crown, and was always setting them forth and
pressing them. If his claims were just, why should he not
press them? If a man makes a claim and does not press it,
what does it mean except that he is afraid of pressing it or
that it is an unjust claim?</p>

<p>The estates which he owned, apart from the claims which
were never settled, amounted altogether to a very considerable
property well worth defending. He had no fewer than
ninety-four manors: there were four residences&mdash;Caister:
Southwark: Castle Scrope, and another: there was a sum of
money in the treasure chest of 2,643<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>, equivalent to about
50,000<i>l.</i> of our money. There were no banks in those days
and no investments: a gentleman bought lands and plate
and armour and weapons: he spent, as a rule, the greater
part of his income, showing his wealth and his rank by the
splendid manner of living. Sir John Fastolf, for instance,
had 3,400 oz. of silver plate; and besides, a wardrobe full of
costly robes.</p>

<p>His house stood on the banks of the river in Stoney
Lane, which now leads from Tooley Street to Pickleherring
Street. The Knight had good neighbours. On the east of
St. Olave's Church was the ancient house built in the 12th
century for the Earl of Warren and Surrey, and given by his
successor to the Abbot of St. Augustine's, Canterbury. Next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
to the Abbot's Inn came, with the Bridge House between,
the Abbot of Battle's Inn, a great building on the river
bank, with gardens lying on the other side of what is now
Tooley Street. The site was long marked by 'The Maze'
and 'Maze Pond.' Then came Fastolf's House. There are
no means of ascertaining the appearance or the size of the
place. It was certainly a building round a quadrangle
capable of housing many followers, because he proposed to
fill it with a garrison and so to meet Cade's insurgents.
Moreover, a man of such great authority and wealth would
not be contented with a small house. On the south side of
St. Olave's Church, nearly opposite Fastolf's house, was the
Inn or House of the Abbot of Lewes. And half a mile
across the fields and gardens rose the towers and walls of
St. Saviour's Abbey, Bermondsey. Perhaps there were other
great houses east of Sir John Fastolf's, but I think not,
because as late as 1720 fields begin a little to the east of
Stoney Lane. Now, though fields precede houses, houses
seldom precede fields. A house often degenerates, but is
rarely converted into a meadow. This, however, did happen
with Kennington Palace. We know, for example, that the
house called Augustin's Inn came to the Sellinger family,
and being deserted by them was presently let out in tenements
till it was pulled down and replaced by other buildings.
According to these indications, then, Fastolf's house
was the last of the great houses on the east side of London
Bridge. There is another proof that it was a large house.
Fastolf kept a fleet of coasting vessels which continually
sailed from Caister or Yarmouth to London bringing provisions
and supplies of all kinds for his house at Southwark.
This fact not only proves that his household was very large,
but it illustrates one way in which the great houses, the
ecclesiastical houses and the nobles' houses were victualled.
If those whose manors lay within easy reach of a port kept
ships for the conveyance of provisions from the country to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
London it is certain that those who lived inland sent up
caravans of pack-horses laden with the produce of their
estates and sent up to town flocks of cattle and sheep and
droves of pigs.</p>

</div>

<p>I have spoken of Sir John's intention to make a stand at
Southwark against the rebels under Cade. Fortunately for
himself and for everybody with him, he was persuaded to
retire across the river to the Tower before the rebels reached
the gates. The story is one of the most interesting in the
whole of the 'Paston Letters,' which, to tell the truth, unless
one looks into them for persons we already know, are somewhat
dull in the reading.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span></p>

<p>When the Commons of Kent were reported to be
approaching London in the year 1450, Sir John Fastolf filled
his house in Southwark with old soldiers from Normandy
and 'abyllyments' of war. This rumour reached the rebels
and naturally caused them considerable anxiety. So when
they caught a spy among them in the shape of one John Payn,
a servant of Sir John, they were disposed to make an example
of him. And now you shall hear what happened to John Payn
in his own words, the spelling being only partly modernised.</p>

and al so sone as I come to the Blakheth, the capteyn<a name="FNanchor_3_7" id="FNanchor_3_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_7" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> made
the comens to take me. And for the savacion of my maisters
horse, I made my fellowe to ryde a way with the ij. horses;
and I was brought forth with befor the Capteyn of Kent.
And the capteyn demaundit me what was my cause of comyng

Fastolfes men, and the ij. horse were Syr John Fastolfes;
and then the capteyn lete cry treson upon me thorough all
the felde, and brought me at iiij. partes of the feld with a
harrawd of the Duke of Exeter<a name="FNanchor_4_8" id="FNanchor_4_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_8" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> before me in the dukes cote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
of armes, makyng iiij. <i>Oyes</i> at iiij. partes of the feld; proclaymyng
opynly by the seid harrawd that I was sent thedyr
for to espy theyre pusaunce, and theyre abyllyments of werr,
fro the grettyst traytor that was in Yngelond or in Fraunce,
as the seyd capteyn made proclaymacion at that tyme, fro

the garrisons of Normaundy, and Manns, and Mayn, the whech
was the cause of the lesyng of all the Kyngs tytyll and ryght
of an herytaunce that he had by yonde see. And morovyr he
seid that the seid Sir John Fastolf had furnysshyd his plase

<p>'And so furthewith I was taken, and led to the capteyns

<p>'Wherupon I come to my maister Fastolf, and brought

that tyme I was caryd abought thorough Kent and Sousex,
and ther they wolde have smetyn of my hede.</p>

<p>'And in Kent there as my wyfe dwellyd, they toke awey
all oure godes movabyll that we had, and there wolde have
hongyd my wyfe and v. of my chyldren, and lefte her no
more gode but her kyrtyll and her smook. And a none aftye
that hurlyng, the Bysshop Roffe,<a name="FNanchor_1_17" id="FNanchor_1_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_17" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> apechyd me to the Quene,
and so I was arestyd by the Quenes commaundment in to the

quarteryd; and so wold have made me to have pechyd my
Maister Fastolf of treson. And by cause that I wolde not,
they had me up to Westminster, and there wolde have sent
me to the gole house at Wyndsor; but my wyves and j.
coseyn of myn noune that were yomen of the Croune, they
went to the Kyng, and got grase and j. chartyr of pardon.'</p>

<p>Here we see the popular opinion of Fastolf 'the greatest
traitor in England or in France:' he who 'mynnyshed all the
garrisons of Normandy, and Manns, and Mayn:' he who was
the cause of the 'lesyng of all the Kyng's tytyll and rights of
an heritaunce that he had by yonde see.'</p>

<p>The whole story is in the highest degree dramatic. Sir
John wants to know what the rebellion means. Let one of
his men go and find out. Let him take two horses in case of
having to run for it: the rebels will most probably kill him if
they catch him. Well: it is all in the day's work: what can
a man expect? Would the fellow live for ever? What can
he look for except to be killed some time or other? So John
Payn takes two horses and sets off. As we expected, he does
get caught: he is brought before Mortimer as a spy. At this
point we are reminded of the false herald in 'Quentin Durward,'
but in this case it is a real herald pressed into the service of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
Mortimer, <i>alias</i> Jack Cade. Now the Captain is by way of
being a gentleman: very likely he was: the story about him,
that he had been a common soldier, is improbable and
supported by no kind of evidence. However, he conducts
the affair in a courteous fashion. No moblike running to the
nearest tree: no beating along the prisoner to be hanged
upon a branch: not at all: the prisoner is conducted with
much ceremony to the four quarters of the camp and at each
is proclaimed by the herald a spy. Then the axe and the
block are brought out. The prisoner feels already the bitterness
of death. But his friends interfere: he must be spared
or a hundred heads shall fall. He is spared: on condition that
he goes back, arrays himself in his best harness and returns to
fight on the side of the rebels.</p>

<p>Observe that this faithful person gets the 'articles' that his
master wants: he also reports on the strength of the rebellion
in-so-much that Sir John breaks up his garrison and retreats
across the river to the Tower. But before going he tells the
man that he must keep his parole and go back to the rebels
to be killed by them or among them. So the poor man puts
on his best harness and goes back.</p>

<p>They spoil him of every thing: and then, they put him
in the crowd of those who fight on London Bridge.</p>

<p>It was a very fine battle. Jack Cade had already entered
London when he murdered Lord Saye, and Sir James Cromer,
Sheriff of Kent, and plundered and fined certain merchants.
He kept up, however, the appearance of a friend of the
people and permitted no plundering of the lower sort. So
that one is led to believe that in the fight the merchants,
themselves, and the better class held the bridge.</p>

<p>The following account comes from Holinshed. It must be
remembered that the battle was fought on the night of Sunday
the 5th of July, in midsummer, when there is no night, but a
clear soft twilight, and when the sun rises by four in the morning.
It was a wild sight that the sun rose upon that morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
The Londoners and the Kentish men, with shouts and cries,
alternately beat each other back upon the narrow bridge,
attack and defence growing feebler as the night wore on.
And all night long the bells rang to call the citizens to arms
in readiness to take their place on the bridge. And all night
the old and the young and the women lay trembling in their
beds lest the men of London should be beaten back by the
men of Kent, and these should come in with fire and sword
to pillage and destroy. All night long without stopping: the
dead were thrown over the bridge: the wounded fell and
were trampled upon until they were dead: and beneath their
feet the quiet tide ebbed and flowed through the arches.</p>

</div>

<p>'The maior and other magistrates of London, perceiving
themselves neither to be sure of goods nor of life well
warranted determined to repell and keepe out of their citie
such a mischievous caitife and his wicked companie. And to
be the better able so to doo, they made the lord Scales, and
that renowned Capteine Matthew Gough privie both of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
intent and enterprise, beseeching them of their helpe and
furtherance therein. The lord Scales promised them his aid,
with shooting off the artillerie in the Tower; and Matthew
Gough was by him appointed to assist the maior and
Londoners in all that he might, and so he and other capteins,
appointed for defense of the citie, tooke upon them in the
night to keepe the bridge, and would not suffer the Kentish
men once to approach. The rebels, who never soundlie slept
for feare of sudden assaults, hearing that the bridge was
thus kept, ran with great hast to open that passage where
between both parties was a fierce and cruell fight.</p>

<p>'Matthew Gough perceiving the rebels to stand to their
tackling more manfullie than he thought they would have
done, advised his companie not to advance anie further
toward Southwarke, till the daie appeared; that they might
see where the place of jeopardie rested, and so to provide for
the same; but this little availed. For the rebels with their
multitude drave back the citizens from the stoops at the
bridge foot to the draw bridge, and began to set fire to
diverse houses. Great ruth it was to behold the miserable
state, wherein some desiring to eschew the fire died upon
their enimies weapon; women with children in their armes
lept for feare into the river, other in a deadlie care how to
save themselves, betweene fire, water, and sword, were in
their houses choked and smothered. Yet the capteins not
sparing, fought on the bridge all the night valiantlie, but in
conclusion the rebels gat the draw bridge, and drowned
manie, and slue John Sutton, alderman, and Robert Heisand,
a hardie citizen, with manie other, beside Matthew Gough, a
man of great wit and much experience in feats of chivalrie,
the which in continuall warres had spent his time in service
of the king and his father.</p>

<p>'This sore conflict indured in doubtfull wise on the bridge,
till nine of the clocke in the morning; for somtime, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
Londoners were beaten backe to saint Magnus corner; and
suddenlie againe, the rebels were repelled to the stoops in
Southwarke, so that both parts being faint and wearie, agreed
to leave off from fighting till the next daie; upon condition
that neither Londoners should passe into Southwarke, nor
Kentish men into London. Upon this abstinence, this rake-hell
capteine for making him more friends, brake up the
gaites of the kings Bench and Marshalsie and so were
manie mates set at libertie verie meet for his matters in hand.'
(Holinshed, iii. p. 226.)</p>

<p>When the rebellion was over they clapped the unlucky
Payn into prison and tried to get out of him some admission
that might enable them to impeach Sir John of treason. This
old soldier was not without some love of letters. One of his
household, William Worcester, wrote for him Cicero 'De
Senectute,' printed by Caxton a few years later. A MS. also
exists in the British Museum called 'The Dictes and Sayings
of the Philosophers,' said to have been translated for him by
Stephen Perope his stepson.</p>

<p>After the Cade rebellion he returned to his house in
Southwark but seldom. He went down into Norfolk,
employed his ships in carrying stone and built his great
castle of Caistor, which covered five acres. He purposed
founding a College at Caistor for seven priests and seven
poor folk. He assisted the building of philosophy schools at
Cambridge: he made gifts to Magdalen College, Oxford.
His intentions as to the College were never carried out,
the bequest being transferred to Magdalen College, Oxford,
for the support of seven poor priests and seven poor scholars.
He died at the age of eighty. It was the misfortune of this
stout old warrior that the latter half of his fighting career was
in a losing cause: it was also his misfortune to incur a great
part of the odium that falls upon a general who is on the
losing side: at the same time, in his own actions he was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
almost without exception, victorious: and there does not
seem any reason why he more than any other should bear
the blame of the English reverses. It was probably in
deference to popular opinion that no honours were paid
to the veteran of so many fights. Perhaps he was not
a <i>persona grata</i> at Court. Certainly the story of Payn's
imprisonment indicates some enemy in high quarters. Why
should the Government desire to charge him with treason?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span></p>

<br />
<br />
THE BOMBARDMENT OF LONDON</h2>


<p>The Bombardment of London, now almost as much forgotten
as the all-night battle of London Bridge, took place also on a
Sunday, twenty years afterwards. It was the concluding
scene, and a very fit end&mdash;to the long wars of the Roses.</p>

<p>There was a certain Thomas, a natural son of William
Nevill, Lord Fauconberg, Earl of Kent, generally called the
Bastard of Fauconberg, or Falconbridge. This man was a
sailor. In the year 1454 he had received the freedom of the
City of London and the thanks of the Corporation for his
services in putting down the pirates of the North Sea and the
Channel. It is suggestive of the way in which the Civil War
divided families, that though the Earl of Kent did so much to
put Edward on the throne, his son did his best to put up
Henry.</p>

<p>He was appointed by Warwick Vice-Admiral of the Fleet,
and in that capacity he held Calais and prevented the despatch
of Burgundians to the help of Edward. He seems to have
crossed and recrossed continually.</p>

<p>A reference to the dates shows how slowly news travelled
across country. On April the 14th the Battle of Barnet was
fought. At this battle Warwick fell. On May the 4th the Battle
of Tewkesbury finished the hopes of the Lancastrians. Yet
on May the 12th the Bastard of Fauconberg presented himself
at the head of 17,000 Kentish men at the gates of London
Bridge, and stated that he was come to dethrone the usurper
Edward, and to restore King Henry. He asked permission
to march through the town, promising that his men should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
commit no disturbance or pillage. Of course they knew
who he was, but he assured them that he held a commission
from the Earl of Warwick as Vice-Admiral.</p>

<p>In reply, the Mayor and Corporation sent him a letter,
pointing out that his commission was no longer in force
because Warwick was dead nearly three weeks before, and
that his body had been exposed for two days in St. Paul's; they
informed him that the Battle of Barnet had been disastrous
to the Lancastrians, and that runners had informed them of
a great Lancastrian disaster at Tewkesbury, where Prince
Edward was slain with many noble lords of his following.</p>

<p>All this Fauconberg either disbelieved or affected to
disbelieve. I think that he really did disbelieve the story:
he could not understand how this great Earl of Warwick
could be killed. He persisted in his demand for the
right of passage. The persistence makes one doubt the
sincerity of his assurances. Why did he want to pass
through London? If he merely wanted to get across he had
his ships with him&mdash;they had come up the river and now lay
off Ratcliffe. He could have carried his army across in less
time than he took to fight his way. Did he propose to hold
London against Edward, and to keep it while the Lancastrians
were gathering strength? There was still one Lancastrian
heir to the throne at least.</p>

<p>However, the City still refused. They sent him a letter
urging him to lay down his arms and acknowledge Edward,
who was now firmly established.</p>

<p>Seeing that he was not to be moved, the citizens began
to look to their fortifications: on the river side the river wall
had long since gone, but the houses themselves formed a wall,
with narrow lanes leading to the water's edge. These lanes
they easily stopped with stones: they looked to their wall
and to their gates.</p>

<p>The Bastard therefore resolved upon an assault on the
City. Like a skilful commander he attacked it at three
points. First, however, he brought in the cannon from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
ships, laying them along the shore: he then sent 3,000 men
across the river with orders to divide into two companies, one
for an attack on Aldgate, the other for an attack on Bishopsgate.
He himself undertook the assault on London Bridge.
His cannonade of the City was answered by the artillery of
the Tower. We should like to know more of this bombardment.
Did they still use round stones for shot? Was much
mischief done by the cannon? Probably little that was not
easily repaired: the shot either struck the houses on the
river's edge or it went clean over the City and fell in the fields
beyond. Holinshed says that 'the Citizens lodged their great
artillerie against their adversaries, and with violent shot
thereof so galled them that they durst not abide in anie place
alongst the water side but were driven even from their own
Ordnance.' Did they, then, take the great guns from the
Tower and place them all along the river? I think not: the
guns could not be moved from the Tower: then the 'heavie
artillerie' could only damage the enemy on the shore opposite&mdash;not
above the bridge.</p>

<p>The three thousand men told off for the attack on the
gates valiantly assailed them. But they met with a stout
resistance. Some of them actually got into the City at
Aldgate, but the gate was closed behind them, and they were
all killed. Robert Basset, Alderman of Aldgate, performed
prodigies of valour. At Bishopsgate they did no good at all.
In the end they fell back. Then the citizens threw open the
gates and sallied forth. The Earl of Kent brought out 500
men by the Tower Postern and chased the rebels as far as
Stepney. Some seven hundred of them were killed. Many
hundreds were taken prisoners and held to ransom, 'as if they
had been Frenchmen,' says the Chronicler.</p>

<p>The attack on the bridge also completely failed. The
gate on the south was fired and destroyed: three score of
the houses on the bridge were fired and destroyed: the north
gate was also fired, but at the bridge end there were planted
half a dozen small pieces of cannon, and behind them waited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
the army of the citizens. It is a pity that we have not another
Battle of the Bridge to relate.</p>

<p>The captain, seeing that he had no hopes of getting
possession of London, resolved to march westward and meet
Edward. By this time, it is probable that he understood
what had happened. He therefore ordered his fleet to await
him in the Mersey, and marched as far as Kingston-upon-Thames.
It is a strange, incongruous story. All his friends
were dead: their cause was hopeless: why should he attempt
a thing impossible? Because it was Warwick's order?
Perhaps, however, he did not think it impossible.</p>

<p>At Kingston he was met by Lord Scales and Nicolas
Fanute, Mayor of Canterbury, who persuaded him 'by fair
words' to return. Accordingly, he marched back to Blackheath,
where he dismissed his men, ordering them to go home
peaceably. As for himself, with a company of 600&mdash;his
sailors, one supposes&mdash;he rejoined his fleet at Chatham, and
took his ships round the coast to Sandwich.</p>

<p>Here he waited till Edward came there. He handed over
to the King fifty-six ships great and small. The King
pardoned him, knighted him, and made him Vice-Admiral of
the Fleet. This was in May. Alas! in September we hear
that he was taken prisoner at Southampton, carried to Middleham,
in Yorkshire, and beheaded, and his head put upon
London Bridge.</p>

<p>Why? nobody knows. Holinshed suggests that he had
been 'roving,' <i>i.e.</i> practising as a pirate. But would the Vice-Admiral
of the English fleet go off 'roving'? Surely not. I
take it as only one more of the thousand murders, perjuries,
and treacheries of the worst fifty years that ever stained the
history of the country. There was but one complete way of
safety for Edward&mdash;the death of every man, noble or simple,
who might take up arms against him. So the Bastard&mdash;this
fool who had trusted the King and given him a fleet&mdash;was
beheaded like all the rest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span></p>

<p>The town was full of those who carried in their hats the
pilgrim's signs. Besides the ordinary insignia of pilgrimage,
every shrine had its special signs, which the pilgrim on his
return bore conspicuously upon his hat or scrip or hanging
round his neck (see Skeat, <i>Notes to Piers Plowman</i>) in
token that he had accomplished that particular pilgrimage.
Thus the ampullæ were the signs of Canterbury; the scallop
shell that of St. James of Compostella; the cross keys and
the vernicle of Rome&mdash;the vernicle was a copy of the handkerchief
of St. Veronica, which was miraculously impressed with
the face of our Lord. These shrines were cast in lead in the
most part. Thus in the supplement to the <i>Canterbury Tales</i>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then as manere and custom is, signes there they bought,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And in the meanwhile the miller had y-piked<br /></span>

<p>Erasmus makes Menedemus ask, 'What kind of attire is
this that thou wearest? It is all set over with shells scolloped,
full of images of lead and tin, and charms of straw work, and
the cuffs are adorned with snakes' eggs instead of bracelets.'
To which the reply is that he has been to certain shrines on
pilgrimage. The late Dr. Hugo communicated to the Society
of Antiquaries a paper in which he enumerated and figured a
great many of these signs found in different places, but
especially in the river when Old London Bridge was removed.
Bells&mdash;<i>Campana Thomæ</i>&mdash;Canterbury Bells&mdash;were also hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
from the bridles, ringing merrily all the way by way of a
charm to keep off evil.</p>

<p>Every day in the summer parties of pilgrims started from
one or other of the Inns of Southwark: there was the short
pilgrimage and the long pilgrimage: the pilgrimage of a day:
the pilgrimage of a month: and the pilgrimage beyond the
seas. From Southampton and at Dartmouth sailed the ships
of those who were licensed to carry pilgrims to Compostella,
which was the shrine of St. Iago: or to Rome: or to
Rocamadom in Gascony: or to Jaffa for the Holy Places.
The pilgrimage <i>outremer</i> is undoubtedly that which conferred
the longest indulgences, the greatest benefits upon the
soul, and the highest sanctity upon the pilgrim.</p>

<p>In the matter of short pilgrimages, the South Londoner
had a considerable choice. He might simply go to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
shrine of St. Erkenwald at Paul's, or to that of Edward the Confessor
at Westminster, he might even confine his devotions to
the Holy Rood of Bermondsey. If he wished to go a little
further afield, there were the shrines of Our Lady of the Oak;
of Muswell Hill; or of Willesden. But these were all on the
north side of London and belonged to the City rather than
to Southwark. For him of the Borough there was the shrine
of Crome's Hill, Greenwich, which provided a pleasant outing
for the day: it might be prolonged with feasting and drinking
to fill up the whole day, so that the whole family could get a
holiday combined with religious exercises in good company
and return home at night, each happy in the consciousness
that so many years were knocked off purgatory.</p>

<p>For the longer pilgrimages there were of course the far
distant journeys to Jerusalem, generally over land as far as
Venice, and then by a 'personally conducted' voyage, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
captain providing escort to and from the Holy Places.
There were also pilgrimages to Compostella: to Rome: to
Cologne: and other places.</p>

<p>For pilgrimage within the four seas, the pious citizen of
South London had surely no choice. For him St. Thomas
of Canterbury was the only Saint. There were other Saints,
of course, but St. Thomas was his special Saint. No other
shrine was possible for him save that of St. Thomas. Not
Glastonbury: nor Walsingham: nor Beverley: but Canterbury
contained the relics the sight and adoration of which would
more effectively assist his soul.</p>

<span class="caption">CANTERBURY PILGRIMS</span>
</div>

<p>In Erasmus's Dialogue of the Pilgrimage we have an
account of what was done and what was shown at the shrines
of Our Lady of Walsingham and St. Thomas of Canterbury.</p>

<p>'The church that is dedicated to St. Thomas raises itself
up towards heaven with that majesty that it strikes those that
behold it at a great distance with an awe of religion, and now
with its splendour makes the light of the neighbouring
palaces look dim, and as it were obscures the place that was
anciently the most celebrated for religion. There are two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
lofty turrets which stand as it were bidding visitants welcome
from afar off, and a ring of bells that make the adjacent
country echo far and wide with their rolling sound. In the
south porch of the church stand three stone statues of men in
armour, who with wicked hands murdered the holy man, with
the names of their countries&mdash;Tusci, Fusci, and Betri....</p>

<p>'<i>Og.</i> When you are entered in, a certain spacious majesty
of place opens itself to you, which is free to every one. <i>Me.</i>
Is there nothing to be seen there? <i>Og.</i> Nothing but the bulk
of the structure, and some books chained to the pillars,
containing the gospel of Nicodemus and the sepulchre of
I cannot tell who. <i>Me.</i> And what else? <i>Og.</i> Iron grates
enclose the place called the choir, so that there is no entrance,
but so that the view is still open from one end of the church
to the other. You ascend to this by a great many steps,
under which there is a certain vault that opens a passage to
the north side. There they show a wooden altar consecrated
to the Holy Virgin; it is a very small one, and remarkable
for nothing except as a monument of antiquity, reproaching
the luxury of the present times. In that place the good man
is reported to have taken his last leave of the Virgin, when
he was at the point of death. Upon the altar is the point of
the sword with which the top of the head of that good prelate
was wounded, and some of his brains that were beaten out,
to make sure work of it. We most religiously kissed the
sacred rust of this weapon out of love to the martyr.</p>

<p>'Leaving this place, we went down into a vault underground;
to that there belong two showmen of the relics.
The first thing they show you is the skull of the martyr, as it
was bored through; the upper part is left open to be kissed,
all the rest is covered over with silver. There is also shown
you a leaden plate with this inscription, Thomas Acrensis.
And there hang up in a great place the shirts of hair-cloth,
the girdles, and breeches with which this prelate used to
mortify his flesh....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span></p>

<p>'<i>Og.</i> From hence we return to the choir. On the north
side they open a private place. It is incredible what a world
of bones they brought out of it, skulls, chins, teeth, hands,
fingers, whole arms, all which we having first adored, kissed;
nor had there been any end of it had it not been for one of
my fellow-travellers, who indiscreetly interrupted the officer
that was showing them....</p>

<p>'After this we viewed the table of the altar, and the
ornaments; and after that those things that were laid up
under the altar; all was very rich, you would have said
Midas and Croesus were beggars compared to them, if you
beheld the great quantities of gold and silver....</p>

<p>'After this we were carried into the vestry. Good God!
what a pomp of silk vestments was there, of golden candlesticks!
There we saw also St. Thomas's foot. It looked
like a reed painted over with silver; it hath but little of
weight, and nothing of workmanship, and was longer than up
to one's girdle. <i>Me.</i> Was there never a cross? <i>Og.</i> I saw
none. There was a gown shown; it was silk, indeed, but coarse
and without embroidery or jewels, and a handkerchief, still
having plain marks of sweat and blood from the saint's neck.
We readily kissed these monuments of ancient frugality....</p>

<p>'From hence we were conducted up higher; for behind the
high altar there is another ascent as into another church. In
a certain new chapel there was shewn to us the whole face of
the good man set in gold, and adorned with jewels....</p>

<p>'Upon this, out comes the head of the college. <i>Me.</i> Who
was he, the abbot of the place? <i>Og.</i> He wears a mitre, and
has the revenue of an abbot&mdash;he wants nothing but the name;
he is called the prior because the archbishop is in the place of
an abbot; for in old time every one that was an archbishop of
that diocese was a monk. <i>Me.</i> I should not mind if I was called
a camel, if I had but the revenue of an abbot. <i>Og.</i> He seemed
to me to be a godly and prudent man, and not unacquainted
with the Scotch divinity. He opened us the box in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
the remainder of the holy man's body is said to rest. <i>Me.</i>
Did you see the bones? <i>Og.</i> That is not permitted, nor can
it be done without a ladder. But a wooden box covers a
golden one, and that being craned up with ropes, discovers
an inestimable treasure. <i>Me.</i> What say you? <i>Og.</i> Gold
was the basest part. Everything sparkled and shined with
very large and scarce jewels, some of them bigger than a
goose's egg. There some monks stood about with the greatest
veneration. The cover being taken off, we all worshipped.
The prior, with a white wand, touched every stone one by
one, telling us the name in French, the value of it, and who
was the donor of it. The principal of them were the presents
of kings....</p>

<p>'Hence he carried us back into a vault. There the Virgin
Mary has her residence; it is something dark; it is doubly
railed in and encompassed about with iron bars. <i>Me.</i> What
is she afraid of? <i>Og.</i> Nothing, I suppose, but thieves. And
I never in my life saw anything more laden with riches.
<i>Me.</i> You tell me of riches in the dark. <i>Og.</i> Candles being
brought in we saw more than a royal sight. <i>Me.</i> What, does
it go beyond the Parathalassian virgin in wealth? <i>Og.</i> It
goes far beyond in appearance. What is concealed she knows
best. These things are shewn to none but great persons or
peculiar friends. In the end we were carried back into the
vestry. There was pulled out a chest covered with black
leather; it was set upon the table and opened. They all fell
down on their knees and worshipped. <i>Me.</i> What was in it?
<i>Og.</i> Pieces of linen rags.'</p>

<p>At Canterbury, as at Walsingham, the object of the pilgrim
was to see the relics, kiss them, saying certain prayers prescribed,
and to make offerings at every exhibition of relics.
Thus on beholding the precious place containing the milk of
the Virgin, the pilgrim recited the following prayer:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Virgin Mother, who hast merited to give suck to the Lord
of heaven and earth, thy Son Jesus, from thy virgin breasts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
we desire that, being purified by His blood, we may arrive at
that happy infant state of dovelike innocence in which, being
void of malice, fraud, and deceit, we may continually desire
the milk of the evangelical doctrine, until we grow up to a
perfect man, and to the measure of the fulness of Christ,
whose blessed society thou wilt enjoy for evermore, with the
Father and the Holy Spirit. Amen.'</p>

<p>On being shown the little chapel which was the actual
dwelling-place of the Virgin like the Casa Sancta of Loreto,
the pilgrim prostrated himself and recited as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>'O thou who only of all women art a mother and a virgin,
the most happy of mothers and the purest of virgins, we that
are impure do now come to visit and address ourselves to thee
that art pure, and reverence thee with our poor offerings,
such as they are. Oh that thy Son would enable us to
imitate thy most holy life, that we may deserve, by the grace
of the Holy Spirit, to conceive the Lord Jesus in the most
inward bowels of our minds, and having once conceived Him,
never to lose Him. Amen.'</p>

<p>As regards the offerings, it was found necessary to station
a priest at each place in order to encourage the pilgrims to
give openly in the sight of all, otherwise they would give
nothing at all, so great was their piety. Nay, even with this
stimulus, there were found some who, while they laid their
offering on the altar, by sleight of hand would steal what
another had laid down. Since pilgrimage was reduced to the
easy performance of a journey with recitals and repetitions of
set prayers, one easily imagines that the pilgrims would no
more hesitate to steal from the altar than to commit any other
offence against morality.</p>

<p>On returning from Canterbury to London the pilgrims
were waylaid by roadside beggars who came out and sprinkled
them with holy water, and showed them St. Thomas's shoe to
kiss. In fact, what with the treasures brought home by pilgrims,
presented to archbishops and kings, and sold by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
pardoners and friars, the whole country was crammed with
relics; at the great shrines as shown by Erasmus, there were
cupboards filled with holy bones and precious rags; but there
were too many: the credulity of the people had been tried
too much and too long. Erasmus shows the profound disbelief
that he himself, if no other, entertained for the sanctity
of the relics.</p>

<p>Thomas à Becket was canonised in 1173. Fifty years
afterwards his remains were transferred from their original
resting-place by Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury,
to the shrine prepared for them behind the high altar.</p>

<p>Erasmus, whose contempt for pilgrimage is sufficiently
indicated by the extracts quoted above, was not alone in his
opinions. Indeed, it required no great wisdom to perceive
that a religious pilgrimage conducted without the least attention
to the religious life was a mockery.</p>

<p>Nor was Erasmus the first to make this discovery. Piers
Plowman, long before, had expressed the same contempt for
pilgrims:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>But there is a more serious indictment still.</p>

<p>In the year 1407, a certain priest named Thorpe, a
prisoner for heretical opinions, was allowed to state these
opinions to Archbishop Arundel. An account remains, written
by the priest himself, of his arguments and of the Archbishop's
replies. On the subject of pilgrimage he is very
strong.</p>

<p>'Wherefore, Syr, I have prechid and taucht openlie, and
so I purpose all my lyfe tyme to do with God's helpe saying
that suche fonde people wast blamefully God's goods in ther
veyne pilgrimagis, spending their goodes upon vicious hostelers,
which ar ofte unclene women of their bodies: and
at the leste those goodes with the which thei should doo
werkis of mercie after Goddis bidding to pore nedy men and
women. Thes poor mennis goodes and their lyvelode thes
runners aboute offer to rich priestis, which have mekill more
lyvelode than they need: and thus those goodes they waste
wilfully and spende them unjustely against Goddis bidding
upon straungers, with which they shoulde helpe and releve
after Goddis will their poor nedy neighbours at home: ye,
and over this foly, ofte tymes diverse men and women of thes
runners thus madly hither and thither in to pilgrimage borowe
hereto other mennis goodes, ye and sometymes they stele
mennis goodes hereto, and they pay them never again. Also,
Syr, I know well that when diverse men and women will go
thus often after their own willes, and finding out one pilgrimage,
they will order with them before to have with them both
men and women that can well syng countre songes and some
other pilgremis will have with them baggepipes; so that every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
timme they come to rome, what with the noyse of their synging
and with the sounde of their piping and with the jangeling
of their Canterbury bellis, and with the barking out of doggis
after them, that they make more noise than if the King came
there away with all his clarions, and many other minstrellis.
And if these men and women be a moneth in their pilgrimage,
many of them shall be an half year after great jangelers, tale
tellers, and lyers.'</p>

<p>'And the Archbishop said to me, "Leude Losell, Thou
seest not ferre ynough in this matter, for thou considerest
not the great trauel of pilgremys, therefore thou blamest the
thing that is praisable. I say to the that it is right well
done that pilgremys have with them both singers and also
pypers, that whan one of them that goeth barfoote striketh his
toe upon a stone and hurteth hym sore, and makyth him to
blede: it is well done that he or his felow begyn then a songe,
or else take out of his bosom a baggepipe for to drive away
with suche myrthe the hurt of his felow. For with soche
solace the trauel and weeriness of pilgremys is lightely and
merily broughte forth."'</p>

<p>From the immortal company of pilgrims which left the
Tabard Inn, High Street, Southwark, on the 2nd day of April
in, or about, the year 1380, it remains for me to show what
pilgrims and pilgrimage meant in the fourteenth century.
This company met by appointment the night before the day of
departure. They did not agree with each other, but they met
by chance. At present, when a party starts for Palestine or
for a voyage round the Mediterranean, the members do not
agree to meet: they find out that a party will start on such a
date from such a place, and they join it. Part of the business
of the Tabard, and of other inns of Southwark, was to organise
and to conduct such a party to Canterbury and back. As the
ships licensed to carry pilgrims charged so much for the
voyage there and back, including the visit to the shrine, so
the Host of the Tabard charged so much for conducting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
entertaining the party there and back again. That the company
was collected in this manner and not by personal agreement,
is shown by their mixed character; and the ready way in
which they all journeyed together, travelled together, and
talked together shows that society of the fourteenth century
was no respecter of persons, or that pilgrimage was a great
leveller of rank.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the company:&mdash;</p>

<p>1.&mdash;A Knight, his Son, and an attendant Yeoman. 2.&mdash;A
Prioress: an attendant Nun: and three Priests. 3.&mdash;A
Monk and a Friar. 4.&mdash;A Merchant. 5.&mdash;A Clerk of
Oxford. 6.&mdash;A Serjeant at Law. 7.&mdash;A Franklin. 8.&mdash;A
Haberdasher, a Carpenter, a Weaver, a Dyer, and a Tapestry
Maker, all clad in the livery of a Fraternity. 9.&mdash;A Sailor
and a Cook. 10.&mdash;A Physician, 11.&mdash;The Wife of Bath.
12.&mdash;A Town Parson and a Ploughman. 13.&mdash;A Reeve, a
Miller, a Sompnour, a Pardoner, a Maunciple, and the Poet
himself.</p>

<p>With them all went the Host of the Tabard. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
generally supposed that they rode the whole way to Canterbury,
which is sixty-six miles, in a single day. Their resting places
have, however, been found by Professor Skeat. Allow them
sixteen hours for the journey. This means more than four
miles an hour without any halt. But so large a company
must needs go slowly and stop often. We cannot believe that
in the fourteenth century such a company would travel sixty-six
miles a day over such roads as then existed, and at a time
of year when the winter mud had not yet had time to dry.</p>

<p>It is not without significance that out of the whole number
a third should belong to the Church. Among them the
Prioress Madame Eglantine is a gentlewoman who might
belong to any age: tenderhearted: delicate and dainty: fond
of creatures: courteous in her manner: careful in her eating:
wearing a brooch,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On whiche was first i-writen a crowned A,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And aftir, <i>Amor vincit omnia</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Monk was a mighty hunter: a big burly man who
kept many horses and hounds and loved to hunt the hare.</p>

<p>The Friar was a Limitour, one licensed to hear confessions:
a wanton man who married many women 'at his
own cost:' he heard confessions, sweetly imposing light
penance: he knew all the taverns: he could play and sing:
he knew all the rich people in his district: he carried knives
and pins as gifts for the women:&mdash;a wholly worldly loose
living Limitour.</p>

<p>The character of the Town Parson, brother of the
Ploughman, is perhaps the most charming of all this
wonderful group of portraits.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The Sompnour, <i>i.e.</i> Summoner of the Ecclesiastical Courts,
was a scorbutic person with an inflamed face: children were
afraid of him: he loved strong meat and strong drink. If he
found a good fellow anywhere he bade him have no fear of
the archdeacon's curse unless his soul were in his purse.</p>

<p>Lastly, there was the Pardoner. He, too, was as jolly as
the Monk, the Friar, and the Sompnour. He carried in his
wallet pardons from Rome; and relics without end: all the
imagination in the nature of certain classes was lavished upon
the invention of relics. Thus it required a fine power of
imagination to show a bit of canvas as a piece of the sail of
St. Peter's boat when Christ called him. This, however, the
Pardoner did. Chaucer makes him reveal his own character.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of avarice and of swiche cursednesse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is al my preching, for to make hem free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To yeve hir pense and namely unto me.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is not without meaning that the poet shows a Monk, a
Limitour, and a Pardoner absolutely without the least tinge
of religion: the first a man who dresses like a layman and
thinks of nothing but of hunting&mdash;what, then, of the Rule?
The second, and the third, are both corrupt and rotten to the
very core. If any proof were wanting that the spiritual life had
gone out of the regular orders, these characters of Chaucer
supply the proof. The figures in this company have been
described, figured, illustrated, annotated a hundred times.
They form the most trustworthy presentation of the time
which we possess. The Knight is full of chivalry, truth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
honour, and courtesy: his son is well bred and lusty, is a lover
and a bachelor. The Merchant talks eagerly and much of
his profits: the Clerk, a poor scholar, would rather have
books than rich robes or musical instruments: the Craftsmen
were all well-to-do, in easy circumstances: the Physician
was an astrologer, who understood natural magic, <i>i.e.</i> the influence
of the stars; and made for his patients images: he
knew the cause of every malady and how it was engendered&mdash;the
profession are still liable to confuse this knowledge
with the power of healing the malady: he was dressed in
crimson and blue, lined with taffeta and silk&mdash;it would be
interesting to know when physicians assumed the black dress
of the last century. Lastly, his study was but little in the Bible.</p>

<p>The Clerk of Oxford is a portrait finished to the life.</p>

<p>Would it be possible to find a clearer picture of what in
those days we should perhaps call a 'lower middle class'
woman than that of the Wyf of Bath? She is dressed in all
the splendour that she can afford: she frankly loves fine
dress.</p>

<p>She is frankly sensual and self-indulgent: she likes everything
that is pleasant: food, drink, love. Observe also the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
restlessness of the woman: she can never have enough of
pilgrimage: she loves the company: the change: the things
that one sees: the people that one meets. She has journeyed
three times to Jerusalem and back: once to Rome: once to
Bologna: once to St. Iago of Compostella: once to Cologne:
apart from the English shrines. We may be quite sure that so
good an Englishwoman would not neglect the saints of her
own country: after Canterbury she would pilgrimise to Beverley
and to Walsingham, and to Glastonbury, and many a local
saint's shrine. She had a ready wit and could give reasons
for everything, especially for her five marriages and her
avowed intentions to take a sixth husband when her fifth
should die. Yet, she declared, she honoured holy virgins.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Many of this company play and sing. The Prioress herself
sings the divine service, intoning it full sweetly by her
nose: the Limitour plays on the rote: the Miller plays the
bagpipe: the Pardoner could sing 'full loud:' the Knight's
son could both sing and play. Music, in fact, as an accomplishment
was far more common in the fourteenth than in
the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Chaucer seems to speak of palmers as if they were the same
as pilgrims. The latter, however, simply journeyed from home
to the shrine and back again: the former was under vows of
poverty, and continually travelled from shrine to shrine.
The Canterbury Pilgrims were not, therefore, palmers. The
first meaning of a palmer was that he could carry a palm in
token of having visited the Holy Land.</p>

<p>When the Prioress spoke the French of Stratford le Bow
it is not intended that she spoke bad French, but the Anglo-French
which was spoken at Court, in the Law Courts, and
by English ecclesiastics of higher rank. But why of Stratford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
le Bow? Because here was a Benedictine nunnery dating from
the eleventh century. The beautiful little Parish Church of
Bow was formerly the chapel of the nunnery. The Wyf
of Bath is 'gat toothed,' <i>i.e.</i> her teeth are wide apart:
Professor Skeat has discovered that an old superstition
attaches to such teeth, that, like the Wyf of Bath, those who
have such teeth will travel far and be lucky. Popular
superstitions are so long lived that one has little doubt
about Chaucer's meaning. Certainly his Wyf of Bath had
travelled far.</p>

</div>

<p>Let us return to the assumption that Chaucer intended the
pilgrimage from Southwark to Canterbury should take but one
day. Is not this conclusion based upon the fact that the last
tale ends a day and the journey at the same time? Is there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
anything to prove that the pilgrimage could have been concluded
in a day there and a day back? Why, I have said that
it was sixty-six miles, and the roads were none of the best:
the party jogged on, I am sure, picking their way over the rough
places and avoiding the quagmires at a steady pace of about
three miles an hour, with many stoppages for rest and for
refreshment. When Cardinal Morton journeyed from Lambeth
to Canterbury for his enthronisation, he took a whole
week over the journey, resting for the night at Croydon,
Knole, Maidstone, Charing, and Chartham. Surely, if a company
of pilgrims could accomplish the distance in a day, the
Archbishop would not take so much as six days? Add to
these considerations that Chaucer is a perfectly 'sane' writer:
his work hangs together: it would have been impossible to get
through all those stories with the intervals between and the
times for rest in a single day.</p>

<p>Another point occurs. There was at one time&mdash;I think&mdash;in
the early days of pilgrimage&mdash;a special service appointed
for the departure of pilgrims&mdash;a kind of consecration of the
pilgrimage. There is no hint of such a service in Chaucer or
in any other writer of the time, so far as I know. There is
none in the Pilgrimage of Felix Fabri of the sixteenth century.
One may suppose, therefore, that the service had been allowed
to drop out of use. Indeed, the original character of the
pilgrimage as a thing to be approached in an altogether
reverential and religious spirit had quite gone out of it even
when Chaucer wrote, not to speak of Erasmus.</p>

<p>The Canterbury Tales, if they are supposed to represent the
manner of talk among the better class of people at that time, are
curiously modern. Witness the description of the Parson and
the Parson's Tale, which is a sermon: witness also the contempt
and hatred of the poet for the shrines of religion: the impostor
with his relics: the Sompnour and the Friar. Chaucer makes
the two latter tell stories reflecting on each other, such great love
had these ecclesiastics between themselves. The poet through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
his Parson preaches a noble form of religion without worry
over doctrine. The Parson promises, when he begins:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wol yow telle a mery tale in prose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To knitte up al this feeste, and make an ende.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Iesu, for His grace, wit me sende<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shewe yow the wey, in this viage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thilke parfit glorious pilgrimage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That highte Ierusalem celestial&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and preaches a sermon on man's heavenward pilgrimage,
taking for his text the passage of Jeremiah, vi. 16: 'Stand
ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the
good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your
souls.'</p>

<p>The priest Thorpe was too hard upon pilgrims. So
was Erasmus. The riding all together: the festive meals at
the inn: the mixture of men and women of all conditions:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
the change of thought and scene&mdash;could not but be useful and
beneficial in the monotonous life of the time. That there
were scandals: that on the way there were drinking and
revelry, with the 'wanton songs' of which Thorpe complains:
that there was an idle parade of pretended relics, and an
assumption of virtues and miracles for these relics: we can
also very well believe: but on the whole it seems a pity that,
when all the relics, with as much wood of the True Cross as
would load a big ship, were gathered together and burned,
something was not introduced to take the place of pilgrimages
and make the people move about and get acquainted with
each other.</p>

<p>What, to repeat, said Archbishop Arundel to Thorpe the
heretic?</p>

<p>'Leude losell, thou seest not ferre ynough in this matter,
for thou considerest not the great trauell of pilgremys, therefore
thou blamest that thing that is praisable. I say to the
that it is right well done, that pilgremys have with them both
syngers and also pypers, that whan one of them that goeth
barfoote striketh his toe upon a stone and hurteth hym sore,
and maketh hym to blede: it is well done that he or his
felow begyn then a songe or else take out of his bosom a
baggepipe for to drive away with soche myrthe the hurt of
his felow. For with soche solace the trauell and werinesse of
pilgremys is lightely and merily broughte forth.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span></p>

<br />
THE LADY FAIR</h2>


<p>The fairs of London were at one time many in number. The
most ancient was that of St. Bartholomew, held in August,
and annexed to the Priory by Henry I. St. James's Fair was
held for the benefit of St. James's Lazar House: there was a
Fair on Tower Hill, granted by Edward III. to St. Katherine's
Hospital: there was the Fair at Tothill Fields, founded by
Henry III.: on the South side there were Fairs at Charlton&mdash;the
Horse Fair: at Greenwich: at Camberwell: at Peckham:
at Lambeth. The Lady Fair, or the Southwark Fair, was of
comparatively late foundation, having been established in the
year 1462 by a Charter of Edward IV. empowering the City of
London to hold a Fair in Southwark every year on the 7th, 8th,
and 9th days of September, with 'all the liberties to such fairs
appertaining,' together with a Court of Pie Powder. Some of
the mediæval fairs were held for the sale of special goods: that
of Cloth Fair, Bartholomew's, for instance: that of Croydon
Cherry Fair: that of Maidstone for hops: that of Royston for
cheese. Most of them, however, were general Fairs held for
the sale of all kinds of goods: the shops were booths arranged
in order side by side, and in streets. One street was for wool
and woollen goods: another for hardware: another for spices:
another for silks, and so forth. The Fair did no harm to the
trade of the nearest town, for the simple reason that most
towns had no trade except in provisions and drink. To the
Fair people came from all quarters to buy or to sell: the
country housewife laid in her stores of spices, sugar, wine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
furs, silks, ribbons, gloves, and everything that she could not
make at home, in these fairs. The Lady Fair of Southwark,
for instance, drew the people from all parts of the country
within reach, but mostly from Clapham, Wandsworth, Streatham,
and Tooting, to buy their stores for the coming year.
There was always, from the beginning, something of a festive
nature about a Fair: the merry crowd suggested feasting and
good company: the drinking tempted one on every side:
there were eating booths as well, and gambling booths, and dancing
booths; and in every one there was music and singing.</p>

<p>When internal communications were improved, and people
could easily ride or drive to the neighbouring town, the
permanent shop replaced the temporary booth, and the original
purpose of the Fair was lost. Then it became, and continued
until the end, merely a place of amusement, and, until it became
riotous, a place of excellent amusement. Nothing is more
ancient or more permanent than the arts and tricks and clevernesses
of the show folk. I have elsewhere remarked on the
singular fact that the comic actor never ceases out of the land:
I do not mean the man who can play a comic part to the
admiration of beholders, but the man who has a genius for
bringing out the comic character in every part and in every
situation. It is the same thing with the juggler, the tumbler,
the posturer, the dancer on the rope and wire, the trainer and
teacher of animals. Dogs, monkeys, bears, horses, were all
trained to perform tricks: women danced on the tight rope:
jugglers tossed knives and balls: men fought with quarterstaff,
single-sticks, rapier, or fist: there were exhibitions of strange
monsters: there were strange creatures. The nature of the
show was proclaimed by a large painted canvas hung outside
the booth.</p>

<span class="caption">BOOTH, SOUTHWARK FAIR</span>
</div>

<p>Evelyn, writing on the 13th of September, 1660, says: 'I
saw in Southwark at St. Margaret's Faire, monkies and asses
dance and do other feates of activity on ye tight rope; they
were gallantly clad <i>à la mode</i>, went upright, saluted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
company, bowing and pulling off their hats; they saluted one
another with as good a grace as if instructed by a dancing-master.
They turn'd heels over head with a basket having
eggs in it without breaking any; also with lighted candles in
their hands and on their heads without extinguishing them,
and with vessels of water without spilling a drop. I also saw
an Italian wench daunce and performe all the tricks of ye
tight rope to admiration; all the Court went to see her. Likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
here was a man who tooke up a piece of iron cannon of
about 400 lb. weight with the haire of his head onely.'</p>

<p>Pepys twice mentions Southwark Fair. The first occasion
was on September 11, 1660. He only says: 'Landing at the
Bear at the Bridge Foot, we saw Southwark Fair.' Eight
years later he pays the Fair a second visit, of which he gives
the following account:</p>

<p>'21 September, 1668. To Southwark Fair, very dirty,
and there saw the puppet-show of Whittington, which is
pretty to see; and how that idle thing do work upon people
that see it, and even myself too! And thence to Jacob
Hall's dancing on the ropes, where I saw such action as I
never saw before, and mightily worth seeing; and here took
acquaintance with a fellow who carried me to a tavern,
whither came the music of this booth, and by and by Jacob
Hall himself, with whom I had a mind to speak, whether he
ever had any mischief by falls in his time. He told me, "Yes,
many, but never to the breaking of a limb." He seems a
mighty strong man. So giving them a bottle or two of wine,
I away.'</p>

<p>Hogarth has preserved for us and for our posterity a faithful
picture of Lady Fair as it was in the year 1733. As it was
in the daytime, remember, not the evening. Hogarth did not
shrink from depicting scenes because they were brutal, or
debauched&mdash;the pen that drew the Rake's midnight orgies
could not plead that anything was too coarse or violent or
abandoned for representation. Had Hogarth drawn a picture
of the Fair in the evening as well as the afternoon we should
have known why the City grew more and more disgusted at
the orgies of the Lady Fair until it became impossible to
tolerate it any longer.</p>

<p>The Fair was held in the open street, between
St. Margaret's Hill and St. George's Church. Beyond
St. George's Church was open country, with a few houses,
&amp;c., as shown in Hogarth's picture which appeared in 1733.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
That part of the Fair which is shown contains two theatrical
booths, Punch's opera, and a waxwork. At one of the theatres,
that of Lee and Harper, is about to be performed Elkanah
Settle's Droll of 'The Siege of Troy.' At the other Theatre,
there is a great show cloth called the Stage Mutiny, referring
to a recent dispute at Drury Lane, and the piece promised is the
'Fall of Bajazet.' The youngest and most beautiful of the
actresses is out before the Booth with a drum, a black boy
playing a cornet, and an actor dressed for the principal part
with a magnificent wig and a towering plumed helmet.
Alas! the great man is arrested at the moment of taking the
picture: at the same moment the stage outside the booth
gives way, and actors and actresses are precipitated headlong:
there will be no performance this day of 'The Fall of Bajazet.'
There is a peep show in the picture: Figg the Prizefighter
rides across the stage, his wig off, so as to show the wounds he
has received: the dwarf Savoyard plays his bagpipe and
makes his dolls jump: there is the cook's shop under the
falling stage: the rope dancer Violante tumbles on the slack
rope: Cardman the aerial performer descends from the tower
of St. George's: a quack eats lighted tow: the conjurer
shows some of his tricks outside, but promises marvels inside
the booth; the rustics gaze in speechless admiration in the
face of the drummer-actress: beyond, we see the beginning
of the line of booths, where everything was sold that was
of no value&mdash;toys, chapbooks, gingerbread, ribbons, cakes,
whips, canes, snuff-boxes, tobacco-boxes, worthless rings,
cloth slippers, night-caps, shoe laces, buckles, soap by the
yard, singing birds and cages for them, tinder-boxes, pewter
platters and mugs. All day long the noise went on: it began
at noon: the people came from the country and from the
city: they dined in one of the booths, off roast sucking pig,
for choice, a diet consecrated to all the Fairs from time
immemorial: the children were brought and treated to a
fairing, the peep-show, and the play, and some gingerbread.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
In the afternoon the country lads wrestled for a hat&mdash;you can
see the hat in the picture; and the girls ran a race for a
smock&mdash;you can see the smock in the picture. When the
sun grew low the children were taken home, and the real fun
of the fair began. Then all the quiet people within hearing
stopped their ears: and all the decent people ran away: and
the prentices, the rustics, the roughs of the Mint with their
correspondencies of the other sex, had their own way until
the weary players put out their footlights and lay down to
sleep as they could among the properties and scenes of their
theatre, and the people of the booths put their wares under the
counters and lay down to sleep upon them like the grocers'
assistants. And then, one supposes, the prentices, the rustics,
and the rogues went home again. And in the morning
repentance and an aching head, and an empty purse.</p>

<p>We may take it that all the amusements and shows which
were brought out for Bartholomew Fair, and for May Fair
while it lasted, were also exhibited at Southwark.</p>

<p>The 'droll,' which was a kind of acting in dumbshow to
music and with singing, was popular; dancing of all kinds
formed a large part of the Fair. In Frost's 'Old Showman,'
there is an advertisement of dancing in a booth:</p>

<p>'THOMAS DALE, Drawer at the Crown Tavern at
Aldgate, keepeth the TURK'S HEAD Musick Booth, in
Smithfield Rounds, over against the Greyhound Inn, during
the time of Bartholomew Fair, Where is a Glass of good Wine,
Mum, Syder, Beer, Ale, and all other Sorts of Liquors, to be
Sold; and where you will likewise be entertained with good
Musick, Singing and Dancing. You will see a Scaramouch
Dance, the Italian Punch's Dance, the Quarter Staff, the
Antick, the Countryman and Countrywoman's Dance, and
the Merry Cuckolds of Hogsden.</p>

<p>'Also a young Man that dances an Entry, Salabrand, and
Jigg, and a Woman that dances with Six Naked Rapiers, that
we Challenge the whole Fair to do the like. There is likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
a Young Woman that Dances with Fourteen Glasses on the
Backs and Palms of her Hands, and turns round with them

<p>The introduction of the theatre with dramas played by
the King's servants should have raised the character of the
Fair. Perhaps it did. In any case, the Theatre of the Fair
was not an unpromising place for a young actor to begin.
The audience wanted nothing but the presentation of a story,
and that a strong and moving story. If an actor failed in the
fire and passion of his part, he was pelted off the stage. He
was therefore compelled to pay attention to the very essentials
of his profession, the presentation visibly and unmistakably of
the emotions. A stagey manner would be the result of too
long continuance on these boards, but at the outset no kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
practice could be more useful. This was proved by the lovely
Mrs. Horton, who was discovered by the manager of Drury
Lane playing at the Lady Fair in the play of 'Cupid and
Psyche.' He took her away and placed her on his own stage,
where she played for many years, leaving behind her a reputation
of the finest actress and the most beautiful woman
known up to that time.</p>

<p>The Theatre of the Fair is, I think, quite gone. I rejoice
in being able to remember one of these delightful shows.
There was a great booth with a platform in front and canvas
pictures hung up behind the platform. The orchestra occupied
one end of the platform, playing with zeal between the performances.
The company in their lovely dresses stood on the
platform and danced a kind of quadrille from time to time:
the clown and the pantaloon, when they were not tumbling,
stood at the head of the broad stairs clanging cymbals and
bawling that the play was just about to begin. The price of
a seat was threepence, with a few rows at sixpence: the play
lasted twenty minutes: it was always a melodrama of persecuted
and virginal innocence&mdash;in white. The joy of the
whole performance was to children beyond all power of words:
the play: the music: the ethereal beauty of the actresses: the
rollicking fun of the clown: the sense of fleeting pleasure conveyed
by the roughness of the benches and the grass under
our feet: and the general festivity of the noise, the music, the
bawling outside make me remember Richardson's Theatre
and Messrs. Doggett's and Penkethman's, with the greatest
pleasure and the most poignant regret.</p>

<p>I fear, then, that Lady Fair became, in the evening especially,
a place in which everybody went 'as he pleased,' and that
with so much dancing, drinking, love-making, singing, playing
on the flowery slope that the authorities had to interfere.
It is, indeed, a most melancholy circumstance that the people
cannot be allowed to amuse themselves in the way they
would choose. May Fair first, Lady Fair next, one after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a></span>
other the Fairs of London have been suppressed. Lady Fair
succumbed in 1760, when it was finally abolished.</p>

</div>

<p>May one say a word of two other fairs even more disreputable&mdash;those
of Charlton and of Greenwich? Charlton Fair
was founded in the year 1268, so that it was a very ancient
institution, to be held on three days in the year&mdash;'the Eve, the
day, and the morrow of the Trinity.' The time of the Fair
was, however, changed at some time to the day of St. Luke,
on October 18. It was one of those Fairs which acquired a
distinctive character. Just as Barnet Fair became a Horse
Fair, Charlton became a Horn Fair. The obvious&mdash;and therefore
popular&mdash;kind of fooling to be made out of horns and
their associations&mdash;which are now quite lost and forgotten&mdash;as
well as the day, which was also connected with those associations&mdash;made
this Fair extremely popular. The people from
London went down to Deptford by boat, joined the people
from Greenwich and Deptford, and formed a burlesque procession,
everyone wearing horns on his head, or carrying
horns to affix to some other person's head. At the fair itself
there was exhibited a great quantity of vessels and utensils
made of horn: every booth had horns put up in the front:
rams' horns were exhibited and sold in quantities; even the
gingerbread was stamped with horns. The reason of this
display was one quite forgotten by the people: viz. that a
horned ox is the recognised symbol of St. Luke. It was
customary for men to dress up, for the burlesque procession,
in women's clothes; they also amused themselves (see
Chambers's 'Book of Days') in lashing the women with
furze: probably in pretence only. The procession was discontinued
in 1768, the Fair went on until 1871.</p>

<p>We must not forget Greenwich Fair, which was held on
Whit Monday. Long after Bartholomew Fair decayed and
fell, Greenwich Fair remained. It was one of the greatest
holidays of the year for the London folk of the lower class.
The amusements consisted of two parts, the first playing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
the Park, where there were races and sports: the second the
fun of the booths and the shows.</p>

<p>The former began early in the forenoon and went on
until the evening. The people came down from London in
boats for the most part, and by the Old Kent Road in
vehicles of every description, or even on foot for the whole
five miles. If it was a fine morning the park was filled
with the working classes and the young men and maidens
belonging to the working classes. The sports were primitive:
the favourite amusement was for a line of youths and girls to
run down hill hand in hand. The slope was steep, the pace
was rapid: before long half of them were sprawling headlong
or rolling over and over, with such displays and derangements
as may be imagined. Or there were games of kiss in the
ring and thread-my-needle: or there were sailors showing
the Cockneys how to dance the hornpipe; men with telescopes
through which could be seen the men hanging in
chains on the Isle of Dogs, or St. Paul's Cathedral: or there
were the old pensioners telling yarns of the battles they had
fought, especially the Battle of Trafalgar, when to every
man, as it seemed, Fortune had caused the hero Nelson to fall
into his arms. Outside the Park the street was filled with
booths where everything could be bought, as at Lady Fair,
which was worthless, including gingerbread. There were
theatrical booths, shows of pictures, pantomimes, Punch and
Judy, exhibitions of monsters, dwarfs, giants, bearded ladies,
mermaids, menageries of wild beasts, feats of legerdemain,
fire-eaters, boxers and quarterstaff players, cock fighting,
and every other conceivable amusement. In the evening,
beside the Theatre, there were the dancing booths. The
same cause which led to the suppression of the Lady Fair
brought about that of Greenwich Fair. It was suppressed,
I think, about the year 1855. I myself saw it in 1851, but
only in the afternoon, when it was already, I remember, a
good-natured crowd playing horse tricks upon each other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
and making a noise, which, with the bellowing of the show
folk, the blaring of the bands, the cries of the boys and girls
on the merry-go-rounds, and the roar of the crowd, one
will never forget. For my own part I am of opinion that the
noise was the worst part of the fair: that what went on in
the evening would have gone on just as much outside the
Fair as in it: and that it did very little harm to let the people
enjoy themselves in their own way, which was a coarse, somewhat
drunken and somewhat indecent way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span></p>

<br />
ST. MARY OVERIES</h2>


<p>London possesses two churches at least of surpassing beauty.
One of them, in the North, is the Church of St. Bartholomew
the Great; the other, in the south, is the church of St. Mary
Overy or Overies, now called St. Saviour's. This church, for
some unknown reason, does not attract many English visitors.
Americans go there in great numbers. It is so beautiful: it has
so many historical associations: that I hope to interest more of
our own people, and, if it may be, to increase the attractions of
the place to the Americans, by a few pages on its history.
These pages are but a sketch, and that a slight sketch, of this
history. I have already in another volume ('London,' p. 47)
given the legend of the foundation of St. Mary Overies. Two
Norman knights, Pont de l'Arche and d'Aunsey, early in the
twelfth century, found here a small Religious House, called
the House of Our Lady of the Canons, which had been created
by Mary the daughter of one Awdry, ferryman. Mary herself
was buried in the chapel of her own House, where is now the
Lady Chapel of St. Saviour's. The name, St. Mary Overies,
which ought to be restored to the Church, seems to mean, not
St. Mary of the Ferry, or St. Mary over the River, but St.
Mary 'Ofers,' or St. Mary of the Bank or Shore. These two
knights founded a new and larger House on the site of Mary
Awdry's modest foundation. For reasons now difficult to
discover, if they matter to anybody, the monks of the Norman
House fell into poverty. In the year 1212, again, they had
the additional misfortune to lose these buildings and their
Church, which were in great part, if not altogether, destroyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
by the great fire of that year. A hundred years later the
monks submitted to Edward I. a pitiful statement that the
whole of their possessions was insufficient so much as to provide
the bare necessities of life without the gifts of the faithful:
that their Church was lying in ruins, and had been in that
condition for thirty years; that they had been unable to
rebuild any of it except the campanile; and that they lived
in constant terror of being inundated by the Thames. This
shows that they had suffered the Embankment to fall into a
neglected state. At the beginning
of the fifteenth century,
Cardinal Beaufort&mdash;Shakespeare's
Cardinal Beaufort&mdash;contributed
largely to the rebuilding
of the Church. Another
benefactor was Gower the poet,
who spent in the Priory the
last years of his life, died here,
and was buried in the Church.
The monument of John Gower
stands in the north aisle of the
newly built nave. The Religious
of the House showed their
gratitude to him by promising
a Pardon of 1,500 days to anyone
who would say a prayer for the soul of the poet.</p>

<p>The position of the Priory, close to the Palace of the
Bishop of Winchester, led to the Church becoming the scene
of many important historical events. Just as Blackfriars was
used for political Functions; just as Wyclyf was tried in St.
Paul's Cathedral, so St. Mary Overies was used on occasions
when the Bishop of Winchester had to do with the matter in
hand. Thus, two great marriages were solemnised in this
Church. One was that of Edmund Holland, Earl of Kent, in
1406, with Lucia, daughter of the Lord of Milan. The bride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
was given away by Henry IV., and her dowry was 100,000
ducats. At her death she left the canons 6,000 crowns for
the good of her soul and that of her husband. The other
marriage was one of far greater importance. It was that of
James the First, King of Scotland, the most pleasing figure
in Scottish history, a poet and a scholar, of whom Drummond
of Hawthornden wrote that 'of former Kings it might be said
that the nation made the Kings, but of this King, that he made
the people a nation.' He married in 1424, being then thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
years of age, after a captivity of nineteen years, Joan, or
Johanna, daughter of the Earl of Somerset, and niece of
Cardinal Beaufort. She was a cousin, therefore, of King
Henry IV. The royal pair rode forth to Scotland laden with
such gifts of plate and cloth of gold as Scotland had never
before seen. They were accompanied by the Cardinal and
his brother, the Duke of Exeter. Twelve years later, the
King was murdered in the presence of his wife, who was
wounded in trying to save him, a sad ending to a marriage of
love, and a tragic widowhood to the woman whom her poet
had called</p>

<p>In 1539 the House was suppressed, the canons were put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
out, and the place was given to Sir Anthony Brown, whose
son became Viscount Montague and gave his new name to the
ancient close of the Monastery. In the following year the
Church was made a Parish Church, including the church of Mary
Magdalene, which stood beside the Priory Church, as St. Peter-le-Poor
stood beside St. Austin, St. Gregory beside St. Paul's,
and St. Margaret beside Westminster Abbey Church together
with the Parish Church of St. Margaret in the High Street. The
nave gradually became ruinous and was taken down in 1838,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
when a new nave, the memory of which makes the whole
Borough shudder when it is mentioned, was put up. Its
floor was raised above that of the transepts, and it was treated
as a separate building, divided from the transepts by a brick
wall. This terrible building has now been taken down and a
nave rebuilt after the pattern of the original structure of the
fourteenth century. Thus reconstructed, the church will soon,
it is hoped, become the Cathedral Church of the Diocese of
Southwark. At present it has not the Cathedral organisation,
being without a Dean, or Canons, or a Chapter. The
Church can boast of more monuments and of a more distinguished
company of the dead than can be found in most
London churches. Here are buried, probably, Mary herself,
the original founder, if she is not a legendary person:
Pont de l'Arche and d'Auncey, the founders: a long
line of unknown and forgotten Priors and Canons of the
Augustinian House: John Gower, on whose monument can
still be read the prayers he wrote for his own soul:</p>

<p>The monument was repaired and painted in 1832 by the
first Duke of Sutherland. Lancelot Andrewes, Bishop of
Winchester, is buried in the Lady Chapel, where his monument
can be seen in black and white marble; Dyer the poet,
who died 1607; Edmund Shakespeare, 'player,' poet and
writer, buried somewhere in the Church, 1607; Laurence
Fletcher, one of the shareholders in the Globe, also buried in
the Church, 1608; Philip Henslow, the manager, buried in the
chancel, 1616; John Fletcher, buried in the Church, 1625;
Philip Massinger, a 'stranger,' <i>i.e.</i> belonging to some other
parish, buried in the Church, 1639. There are three stones
in the chancel, inscribed with the names of John Fletcher,
Edmund Shakespeare, and Philip Massinger, but merely to
record that they are buried somewhere in the Church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span></p>

<p>Other monuments and tombs there are: one a figure,
commonly found in mediæval churches, of a body wasted by
death: a wooden effigy of a knight: a monument to a quack
of Charles the Second's time, and monuments to certain
persons now forgotten; on one some lines in imitation of

<p>The Ladye Chapel, one of the few beautiful things
surviving of mediæval London, was very nearly destroyed by
the ignorant Vandalism of about the year 1835. It was necessary
in rebuilding London Bridge a few feet west of the old
Bridge to prepare new approaches on the south as well as on
the north. What follows is told by Knight:</p>

<p>'The Committee agreed to grant a space of sixty feet for
the better display of St. Mary Overies, on the condition that
the Lady Chapel was swept away. The matter appeared in
a fair way for being thus settled, when Mr. Taylor sounded
the alarm in one of the daily papers. Thomas Saunders,
Esq., and Messrs. Cottinggam and Savage, the architects,
actively interfered. A large majority of the parishioners,
however, decided to accept the proposals of the Committee.
In the meantime, the gentlemen we have named were
indefatigable in their exertions; and they were effectively
seconded by the press. At a subsequent meeting there was
a majority of three only for pulling down the chapel; and
on a poll being demanded and obtained, there ultimately
appeared the large majority of 240 for its preservation. The
excitement of the hour was prudently used to obtain funds to
restore it, which has been most successfully accomplished.'</p>

<p>I have mentioned Winchester House, the Palace of the
Bishop, as being close to the Priory. On any map may
be traced the extent of the Palace. On the north is Clink
Street, the Clink Prison being at the west end of the street;
on the west is now Park Street, formerly Deadman's Place;
on the south is a continuation of Park Street; and on the
east is a street running south from St. Mary Overies Church.
Winchester House, which thus covered a large piece of
ground, was, with its grounds, enclosed by a wall. Many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
the buildings, especially the great gate, remained standing
almost within the memory of man. The state and ceremony
of a Bishop demanded a large retinue, and the Bishop's house
must therefore be provided with a sufficient number of rooms for
their accommodation. The map must not be accepted as
laying down the exact site, the distances or the scale, or the
arrangement of the courts and buildings.</p>

<p>We have now to speak, but briefly, of the Marian Persecutions
and of the Martyrs. With these the Church of St. Mary
and Winchester House had a good deal to do.</p>

<span class="caption">REMAINS OF THE OLD PRIORY, ST. MARY OVERIES</span>
</div>

<p>On Monday, January 28, 1555, was seen the first of many
melancholy sights. On that day Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester,
presided at a Court held in St. Mary Overies Church
for the trial of heretics. The court was actually held in the
Ladye Chapel. Hither were brought Bishop Hooper and
John Rogers: they were heard: they argued their case: they
were found obstinate: they were committed to the Clink
Prison hard by: on the next day, with Bradford, Dr. Crome,
Dr. Saunders, Dr. Ferrar, Dr. Taylor, and several others,
they were sentenced to be burned. Bradford wrote to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
Cranmer after the trial: 'This day, I think, or to-morrow
at the uttermost, hearty Hooper, sincere Saunders, and trusty
Taylor, end their course and receive their crowne. The
next am I, which hourly looke for the Porter to open me the
gates after them, to enter into the desired rest.'</p>

<p>So began those fires from which the cause of Roman
Catholicism long suffered, and is even now still suffering. For
the popular judgment does not discern and separate. The
burnings under Henry and Edward are lumped together
in the mind of the people, and all set down to Mary. The
names, places, and times of the martyrs and their martyrdoms
as given by Machyn, not by Fox, show that if the Queen's
advisers had deliberately done their best to make their form
of Faith odious and hateful, they could not have devised a
better plan than the burning of the people for religion's sake.
It is generally thought and believed that the indignation of
the people was aroused by seeing the Bishops and preachers
burned. That I do not believe. The executions of great men
do not affect the populace; they witness the passage of a
Thomas More on his way to the block: or of a Cromwell:
with equal indifference: these statesmen do not belong to the
life of the people. In the Marian persecution they heard that
Archbishop Cranmer had been burned at Oxford, but they
offered little outward show of emotion: they heard that Ridley
and Latimer had been burned: their constancy, no doubt,
touched the crowd: but still, these martyrs were not of themselves.
When, however, they found that not only Bishops and
great people, but also their own brothers, cousins, fathers, were
taken out from their workshops and tied three or four together
to the stake, where they suffered the agonies of the fire and
still continued to pray aloud with firmness: then the lesson
went straight home to them; and for many a generation to
come the people learned to loathe the very name of the religion
which could thus burn innocent people by the hundred
for believing, as they were told, what the Bible taught.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span></p>

<p>It is a mistake, again, to suppose that the lessons of persecution
were taught at Smithfield alone. They were industriously
taught from many centres. There were burnings at
Stratford-le-Bow: at Stepney: at Westminster: beyond St.
George's, Southwark, at Newington; while the vast crowds
which attended a burning and imbibed these lessons of fear and
hatred are shown by two entries alone in Machyn's Diary,
1556. 'The xxvij day of June rod from Newgate unto Stratford-a-bow,
in iii cares xiij, xj men and ij women, and there
bornyd (burned) to iiij postes, and there where a xx M pepull.'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 347px;"><a name="TOMB_OF_BISHOP_ANDREWS" id="TOMB_OF_BISHOP_ANDREWS"></a>

<span class="caption">TOMB OF BISHOP ANDREWS, ST. MARY OVERIES</span>
</div>

<p>And again, 1556. 'The xxij day of January whent in to
Smythfield to berne between vii and viij in the morning v
men and ij women: on of the men was a gentyllman of the
endor tempull, ys nam Master Grén; and they were all bornyd

London over nyght that no young folke shuld come ther, for
ther the grettest number was as has byne sene at swyche a
tyme.'</p>

<p>Therefore it is evident, first, that enormous crowds
gathered together to witness the sufferings of the victims,
and to note their constancy in the hour of agony; secondly,
that the authorities were becoming alarmed at the effect
which these examples might have upon the young. No
young people were permitted to be present. We may be
sure that the prohibition was openly defied.</p>

<p>As for Gardiner, he died soon after the martyr fires
began, stricken, said his enemies, by the hand of God in
punishment for his cruelties. His physicians, I believe,
called it gout in the stomach, a reading which one prefers,
because Gardiner was no worse than the rest of them, and
after his death there was no abatement, but rather an increase,
in the burnings. He had, however, a very fine funeral, which
began at the church of St. Mary Overies, and was continued
all the way to Winchester, where the place of his burial
and his Chantry Chapel may still be seen.</p>

<p>Of this function, Machyn gives a short account, but it
shall suffice. It must be remembered that Gardiner was not
only a very great person, but that he was also believed to be
the natural son of Bishop Woodville, and, if the belief was
well founded, he was therefore a cousin of the Queen. But
this may be scandal. Machyn, the chronicler of funerals, thus
describes Gardiner's funeral.</p>

<p>The Church, when the Priory was dissolved, stood on the
south side of the monastic buildings: the Cloister occupied
that part of the ground on the north of the nave: the refectory,
chapter house and dormitories, and other buildings
stood about the Cloister: an embankment kept off the
Thames at high tide: on the west side was St. Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
Overies Dock, which was also the south end of the ferry.
The dock is there still, but where the wall of the Monastery
stood, round the Garden, and one could see the orchards
beyond, are now huge warehouses. Some remains of the
Cloister stood until recently, and one gateway of the precinct&mdash;there
was certainly another on the side of the High Street&mdash;stood
close to the west front of the Church. The Cloister
received the name of Montagu Close, after the son of Sir
Thomas Brown who became Viscount Montagu. If you
pass round to the north of the Church you will now find a
few fragments piled up, the indication of an ancient door in
the wall of the Church; but all traces of the monastic
buildings are entirely swept away.</p>

<p>The ground in front of the Church is also changed. In
post-Reformation times there was a school here&mdash;St. Saviour's
school; there were also almshouses; there was a peaceful
quiet kind of close, in which was heard the buzz of the boys
in school; one saw the bedesmen creeping along in the sun;
one watched the crumbling ruins falling fast into decay: one
wondered where in the narrow churchyard or in the Church
lay the bones of Massinger and Fletcher: one seemed to see
Bishop Hooper and John Rogers stepping forth into the
sunlight, their trial over, their sentence passed: their cheeks,
perhaps, somewhat flushed, their eyes somewhat brightened,
because, even with such a faith as theirs, all a man's courage
must be wanted to face the agony of the flames, through
which for half an hour they would have to wade, as Christian
waded through the river, before they reached the shore
beyond.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span></p>

<br />
THE SHOW FOLK</h2>


<p>Southwark was a city of a various population. It had
great Houses for nobles and for Ecclesiastics: it had fair inns
for the reception of merchants, coming up from Kent and
the south country: it had a riverside people of fishermen and
watermen living up stream on the Lambeth bank or down
stream at Bermondsey or Rotherhithe: it had a great number
of residents who worked in the orchards and the gardens
which spread over the whole of the rich low-lying land now
embanked, secure from floods and the highest tides. It
contained, besides, a large number of rogues and vagabonds,
fugitives from justice, lying here in so-called sanctuary, where
the officers of the law did not dare to present themselves.
In spite of the powers granted to the City over Southwark,
the place remained a receptacle and a refuge 'down to the
end of the last century, when the so-called Liberties of the
Mint'&mdash;the last place of sanctuary&mdash;were finally abolished and
only a slum remained to mark the site of a sanctuary.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 396px;"><a name="WINCHESTER_PALACE" id="WINCHESTER_PALACE"></a>

<span class="caption">WINCHESTER PALACE</span>
</div>

<p>Beside all these people Southwark contained the Show
Folk of Bankside. When the Show Folk began to live in
Bankside I know not: their settlement originally was in
Westminster outside the King's Palace, where there was
always a great demand for music, dancing, tumbling, mumming
and such recreative performances; they were also,
however, in great request in London by City Church, city
company, and city tavern. Now there was no place for them
within the walls: they had no company: there was neither a
Musicians'; nor a Dancers'; nor a Singers'; nor a Mummers';<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
nor a Tumblers' Company. There was no company which
would admit them; there was no ward where they could get
a street for themselves: they were gently but firmly pushed
out. And not only were they a class apart but they were a
class in contempt. It was always held contemptible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
provide amusement. No one, as yet, had made of music or
of acting a fine art; no gentleman, as yet, and for a long
time after, would take part in the buffoonery which the actor
had then to exhibit: an atmosphere of disrepute attached
to the calling, to those who followed the calling, and to the
place where they lived: in the City, Aldermen had a way of
connecting nocturnal disorders with these children of melody:
where they resorted the taverns would carry on their revelries
after curfew, even to midnight: if the street was alarmed by
nocturnal ramblers it would prove to be after an evening with
the dancers and the tumblers: the Church, especially the
Church Puritanic, set her face against those who devised
entertainments, on the ground that the devisers were an ungodly
and dissolute crew. Therefore they crossed the river.
On Bankside, in the Liberty of the Clink, where the City
could not interfere, they 'went as they pleased.' They were
dissolute, if they chose&mdash;Heaven knows whether they did
choose&mdash;without reproach: their taverns kept open house as
long as they would stop to drink: there was singing every
day without interference: there was merriment without the
rebuke of the sour face: there was no fear of being haled
before the Lord Mayor, for making people laugh: there was
no terror of pillory, and no man on their side of the river
was 'put in stocks o' Monday, for kissing of his wife o'
Sunday.' It was the Bishop of Winchester's Liberty, but he
was content, on the whole, to leave the residents unmolested
and in the possession of their guitars, their fiddles, their
songs and their plays.</p>

<span class="caption">THE GLOBE THEATRE

</div>

<p>When the Show Folk were wanted in the City it was easy
for them to go across: they were ready at a moment's notice
to arrange a pageant, or to take part in one: they could
provide the beauteous maidens in white with long fair tresses
who stood on platforms in Chepe and scattered gold rose
nobles made of paste on the heads of the crowd: they found
hermits, and constructed caves for those godly men in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
midst of Gracious Street: they found the music for the
dragging of the traitor on a hurdle: for the march of the
rogue to the pillory: for the riding of the Lord Mayor: for
the procession of the Company on its feast day. For a miracle
play they presented the parish church with the Fall of Man:
the Raising of Lazarus: the Pilgrims of Emmaus: David and
Goliath: or any other episode from the Bible&mdash;how many
excellent players there were among them whose names have
long since been forgotten! They knew how to present a
Masque&mdash;not, perhaps, with the same splendour as one by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones&mdash;who commanded the King's
purse&mdash;but a neat and creditable affair, with dresses appropriate,
full of surprises, and furnished with mythological
characters, for the Hall of a City Company on the day of the
Annual Feast. For young gentlemen of the more debauched
kind they had another kind of entertainment, with singing,
dancing girls, tumbling and posturing; with rare jests&mdash;pity
they were not rarer&mdash;and excellent fooling by their clowns.
The modern art of acting did not begin at the Globe
Theatre: there has never been any time when the actor was
unknown: the only difference is that he was not formerly
allowed to be anything but a buffoon: that he had little but
buffoonery in his <i>répertoire</i>: and now he is an artist and
scorns the tricks of the buffoon. Nor is the art of entertainment
of modern invention. The Company of Parish Clerks,
for instance, were great promoters of sacred plays. Their
poets&mdash;whose names are entirely lost&mdash;provided the words and
arranged the scenes; the members of the company played
the parts: the Show Folk 'mounted' the piece: they provided
the monsters; the red flames for the mouth of Hell; the troops
of angels or of devils, the stage business and the music.
Many of the Parish Churches had their annual play on their
Saint's Day. Thus the Parish Church of St. Margaret, which
was taken down when St. Mary Overies' became St. Saviour's,
had its play on St. Margaret's Day (July 20), and often
another on the Day of St. Lucy (December 13) as well.
We have already observed that the Londoner of old
never made any difference in the matter of Play or Pageant
whether the time was summer or winter. He was like the
Scythian, face all over: he felt no cold: he held his Riding, or his
Coronation Procession, quite as readily in December as in July.</p>

<p>Another kind of Show Folk, but rougher and more brutal,
were the people who looked after the bears and the dogs.
Bull baiting, bear baiting, sometimes horse baiting, together
with badger baiting, duck hunting, cock throwing, dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
fighting and cock fighting, were the chosen and common
sports of the people. Baiting of every kind there was
wherever there were dogs and bulls and badgers, but the
centre and headquarters of the sport was South London, in
the place called Paris Gardens. The popularity of the sport
is shown by the simple facts that there was not only bull and
bear baiting in Paris Gardens, but also two rings or amphitheatres
for bull and bear baiting outside the gardens behind
Bankside, and that in the High Street itself, nearly opposite
St. George's Church, there was permanently established the
bull ring to which an animal could be tied whenever one was
found fit for the purpose of affording an hour's sport by the
madness of his rage or the agonies of his death.</p>

<p>The present Blackfriars Bridge Road cuts through the
site of Paris Gardens, leaving a portion on either side. They
extended to the distance of about a quarter of a mile south
of the river: sluggish streams and ditches ran across and
round the gardens, which were so thickly planted with trees as
to be dark in the summer. Both in summer and winter the
place was noisome with exhalations from the marshy soil.
These gardens were the chief home of the rough and cruel
sports already mentioned: here were kept under the King's
bearward the King's dogs; the Mayor's dogs; and the
bears whom they baited. It does not appear that bulls were
also kept here: for baiting purposes it was generally a young
bull that was chosen, and he was baited to death. The bears
were not killed, they were all known to the people by name,
such as Harry Hunks and Sackerson, and were valued in
proportion to the sport they afforded. The dogs, who with
the bears were fed upon the offal and refuse brought
over every day from the Shambles of Newgate, were incredibly
fierce and savage. In these days we hardly know
what a savage dog is, even the bull dog has become peaceful:
formerly, the best defender of the house was the dog who
was unloosed at night: they fed him chiefly on meat: he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
trained to fly at the throat of a stranger: he was a terror to
wayfarers&mdash;remember the dog in the second part of the
'Pilgrim's Progress:' he was always biting and rending
some one: he had the ferocity of the wolf redeemed only by
affection for his master: we have no such dogs in these
days. Accompanied by one or two such fierce mastiffs or bull
dogs who feared no one but their master, a man might
journey from end to end of the country armed with nothing
but a club. Such a dog would fight and would overcome a
man. Kept in the kennels, with insufficient exercise, with
stimulating food, the creatures became fiercer than wolves and
stronger than tigers. The bull they loved to bait: he had
horns and hoofs to dodge: but the bear afforded the best
sport both for man and dog: he presented a nose and ears
and a thick fur on which to spring, and to fasten the canine
teeth upon. What joy to hang on to those ears, torn and
bleeding, the whole dog quivering with rapture even though
in the end one stroke of the bear's hind paw dragged out the
inside of the dog, with the heart and the breath of life!</p>

<p>It was a Royal sport, a sport offered to ambassadors. In
a contemporary Diary it is related that the French Ambassadors,
on May 25, 1559, were entertained at Court with a dinner,
and after dinner with a bull and bear baiting, the Queen herself
looking on from a gallery: the next day they were taken down
the river to see the bull and bear baiting at Paris Gardens. Forty
years later James the First entertained the Spanish Ambassador
after dinner with the bears fighting with greyhounds and with
a bull baiting. About the same time the Duke of Wirtemberg
paid a visit to London and saw the baiting at Paris Gardens:</p>

<p>'On the 1st of September his Highness was shown in
London the English dogs, of which there were about 120, all
kept in the same enclosure, but each in a separate kennel.</p>

<p>'In order to gratify his Highness, and at his desire, two
bears and a bull were baited; at such times you can
perceive the breed and mettle of the dogs, for although they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
receive serious injuries from the bears, are caught by the
horns of the bull, and tossed into the air so as frequently to
fall down again upon the horns, they do not give in, [but
fasten on the bull so firmly] that one is obliged to pull them
back by the tails, and force open their jaws. Four dogs at
once were set on the bull; they, however, could not gain any
advantage over him, for he so artfully contrived to ward off
their attacks that they could not well get at him; on the
contrary, the bull served them very scurvily by striking and
butting at them.'</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="BEAR_GARDEN" id="BEAR_GARDEN"></a>
<img src="images/illus_227.jpg" width="500" height="360" alt="BEAR GARDEN" title="" />
<span class="caption">BEAR GARDEN</span>
</div>

<p>And another contemporary account of a bear baiting is
furnished by Hentzner in 1598:</p>

<p>'There is still another place, built in the form of a
Theatre, which serves for the baiting of bears and bulls: they
are fastened behind, and then worried by those great English
dogs (<i>quos linguâ vernaculâ "Docken" appellant</i>), and mastiffs,
but not without great risks to the dogs from the teeth of the
one and the horns of the other, and it sometimes happens
they are killed on the spot: fresh ones are immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
supplied in the places of those that are wounded or tired.
To this entertainment there often follows that of whipping a
blinded bear, which is performed by five or six men, standing
in a circle with whips, which they exercise upon him without
any mercy; although he cannot escape from them because of
his chain, he nevertheless defends himself vigorously, throwing
down all who come within his reach and are not active
enough to get out of it, tearing the whips out of their hands
and breaking them. At these spectacles, and everywhere
else, the English are constantly smoking the Nicotian weed,
which in America is called <i>Tobaca</i>&mdash;others call it <i>P&#339;tum</i>&mdash;[i.e.
<i>Petun</i>, the Brazilian name for Tobacco, from which the
allied beautiful plant 'Petunia' derives its appellation,] and
generally in this manner: they have pipes on purpose made
of clay, into the farther end of which they put the herb, so
dry that it may be rubbed into powder, and lighting it, they
draw the smoke into their mouths, which they puff out again
through their nostrils like funnels, along with it plenty of
phlegm and defluxion from the head. In these Theatres,
fruits, such as apples, pears and nuts, according to the season,
are carried about to be sold, as well as wine and ale.'</p>

<p>Bear baiting was so popular that fellows roamed about
the country leading a bear which they offered to be baited
for so much an hour at the inns which they passed. The
master of the 'King's Game' had power to seize upon any
mastiff dogs, bears, or bulls for the King's service and to bait
in any place within his dominions. Henslow and Alleyn,
both actors, were also masters of the King's Game: they had
licence to apprehend all vagrants travelling with bears and
bulls.</p>

<p>There was another place where the refining influence of
the bear baiting might be enjoyed. Its site is still preserved
in the lane called Bear Garden Alley. In Agas's map of
1560 an amphitheatre is shown called the 'Bear Baiting:' a
little to the west another amphitheatre is seen called the 'Bull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
Baiting.' Whether these places were the only buildings erected
for this amusement or whether they were put up in addition
to the place in Paris Gardens is a point for the antiquary.
It is learnedly discussed by Mr. Ordish ('Early London
Theatres'). The Spanish Ambassador in 1544 describes a
bear baiting&mdash;but he does not say exactly where he saw it.
'On the other side of the town' is vague. I think, however,
that he must mean Paris Gardens:</p>

<p>'On the other side of the town we have seen seven bears,
some of them very large; they are driven into a circus, where
they are confined by a long rope, while large and courageous
dogs are let loose upon them as if to be devoured, and a fight
takes place. It is not bad sport to witness the conflict. The
large bears contend with three or four dogs, and sometimes
one is victorious and sometimes the other; the bears are
ferocious and of great strength, and not only defend themselves
with their teeth, but hug the dogs so closely with their
forelegs, that, if they were not rescued by their masters, they
would be suffocated. At the same place a pony is baited,
with a monkey on its back, defending itself against the dogs
by kicking them; and the shrieks of the monkey, when he
sees the dogs hanging from the ears and neck of the pony,
render the scene very laughable.'</p>

<p>In the year 1550 Crowley, the author of certain
'Epigrams' against abuses, mentions Paris Gardens (see
Stow and Strype, 1758, vol. ii. p. 8).</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Every Sunday they will spend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One penny or two, the bearward's living to mend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Paris Gardens each Sunday, a man shall not fail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find two or three hundred for the bearward's vale.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Later on there was certainly an amphitheatre in Paris
Gardens, because an accident happened there.</p>

<p>'The same 13th day of Januarie, being Sunday about foure
of the clock in the afternoon, the old and under-propped
scaffolds round about the Beare Garden, commonly called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
Paris Garden, on the south side of the great river Thames
over against the citie of London, over-deluged with people,
fell suddenly downe, whereby to number of eight persons,
men and women, were slaine and many others sore hurt and
bruised to the shortening of their lives. A friendly warning
to all that delight themselves in the cruelties of beastes than
in the workes of mercy, the fruits of a true, professed faith,
which ought to be the Sabbath dayes exercise.' (Stow's
'Annals,' continued by Hawes.)</p>

<p>The amphitheatre would hold a thousand people.</p>

<p>The sport had other dangers: the bear, for instance,
might get loose. Once the blind bear got loose: it was on
December 9, 1554, and on the Bankside, probably at the
amphitheatre outside Paris Gardens. He caught a serving
man by the leg 'and bytt a grate pesse away, and after by
the hokyll bone, that within iii days after he ded' (Machyn).</p>

<p>Wherever such sports were carried on there must needs
spring up a rabble rout who made their living by them: the
bearward, the serving man who kept the kennels, fed the
dogs, exercised the dogs, fed the bears, looked after the
amphitheatre, took the money, and above all provided the
drink. In the little lane now called the Bear Garden, there
is a small square place which I take to be the survival of an
open court in front of the circus. There is here a small
tavern: the house itself is not ancient, but I believe that it
stands on the site of the house which provided wine and beer
for the spectators of the bear baiting. These sports, with
others such as wrestling and fighting: these great crowds of
people gathering together: the music which accompanied
everything: caused the creation of taverns and drinking-places.
Another attraction to the place may be only hinted
at in these pages. Suffice it to say that all the profligate,
all the debauched, all the rowdy, all the lovers of sport among
the citizens of London crossed over to Bankside every
evening in the summer and every Sunday in the winter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
there they frolicked, drank, sang, quarrelled, fought, and tortured
animals to their hearts' content.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to think of Bankside and the fields beyond
it&mdash;the pleasure garden of London. It was easy to get into
the open country on every side of the City walls, but there
was no place so pleasant as the Lambeth Marsh and the Bankside:
none that offered so many and such various attractions.
The flag flying over the Theatre proclaimed that a play was
forward: the number of those who loved the play more than
the baiting increased daily: there was never a time when the
citizens did not love the green fields and the woods: and these
lay behind Paris Gardens and the Bank, beyond the barking
of the dogs and the roar of the crowd and the blare of the
music and the stink of the kennels. Every summer evening
the river was crowded with the boats taking the people across
to the stairs upon the Bank between St. Mary Overies and
Old Barge House Stairs: innumerable were the boats. As
for the watermen, John Taylor, the water poet, says that there
were 40,000 of them plying between Windsor and Gravesend,
while the number of people who were carried over every day
to the plays on Bankside was three or four thousand. Forty
thousand seems an enormous number, but we must remember
that there were no docks: that ships were laden and unladen
in mid stream by barges and boats: that the Thames was the
highway between London and all riverside places; between
London and Westminster; between London and Southwark,
because even if one lived close to the bridge it was easier and
quicker to be taken across by a boat than to walk over the
bridge. The conveyance of three or four thousand people
across the river every day would not want more than a
thousand boats or two thousand watermen: at the same time
the loss of their custom, which happened when the people
went to Blackfriars instead of the Bank for their play, would
be felt by the whole fraternity of watermen.</p>

<p>We have arrived at the time when the bear baiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
attracted less than the play acting: when the amphitheatres
were turned into theatres: and when Bankside became the residence
of the poets and the players. They came; unfortunately
the other people did not go away. There remained the tribe
of them who made the music and found the dancers and the
tumblers, the mummers and the conjurers: there remained
the men&mdash;a rough and brutal lot&mdash;who looked after the bears
and the dogs: the men who wielded quarterstaff and showed
sword play, a swaggering and bullying company: there remained
the young bloods who came over from their peaceful
shops and warehouses to enjoy the sport and the conversation
and talk of the place: there remained the ribald crew of men
and women who naturally belong to such gatherings. There
was another population at Westminster outside the King's
House like unto this at Southwark: these, too, existed for the
amusement of the King's courtiers and men-at-arms. The
Southwark folk existed for the amusements of not the highest
class of London City. The poets came, therefore, to this
place in order to be near these theatres: they brought no
improvement in example, in morals, or in manners: they
lived among the people, and their lives were mostly as disorderly
and their morals as loose as the company among
whom they walked and talked.</p>

<p>Southwark in the early sixteenth century, it may be
noted, consisted of two parts, the one wholly distinct from
the other. The first part was the High Street with its four
churches of St. George's, St. Margaret's, St. Olave's, and St.
Mary Overies: in the High Street were the two Debtors'
Prisons: in the High Street was the ancient hospital: there
also was the long succession of inns, stately, ample, frequented
by merchants and capable of stabling an immense number of
packhorses, and of receiving as many waggons as could fill
the courtyard. The Palaces were mostly gone, turned into
inns or tenements. The whole place was a great House of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
Call. It had no industries, it had no crafts: it had no civic
or corporate existence. But it was respectable.</p>

<p>The other part lay on the west of the High Street,
stretching along the river nearly as far as Lambeth. This
was the disreputable quarter, the place of amusement: the
people who lived there, one and all, made the providing of
amusement, pleasure and excitement their means of livelihood.
It was like a never-ending fair where nothing was
sold, and there were no booths except those of Ursula, with
roast sucking pig, black puddings, custards, and gingerbread.
From every tavern all day long came the tinkling of
the guitar and the trolling of some lusty voice and the silvery
notes of a girl who sang like the wood pigeon because nature
taught her. Here marched along the bear rolling his head from
side to side, a monkey chattering on his back, the tabor and
pipe going before him. After him came the dogs straining
at the chain which held them, barking madly in anticipation
of the fight. Or it was a young bull who was led by
two men to the ring where he would defend his life as long as
the dogs allowed; or it was the arrival at Falcon Stairs of
boats by the dozen, each turning out its complement of
citizens and their wives, who made for the theatre where the
flag was flying. On the open bank were placed tables for those
who drank: the balladmonger sang his songs and sold them
afterwards: the posturer spread his carpet and went through
his performance: the boys cried nuts and apples: the drawer
ran about and filled his cans. In no other part of London
was there a scene of greater animation and cheerfulness than
on Bankside, on an afternoon or evening in the summer.
And then to go home again across the broad and peaceful
river at full tide, when the sun was set, and the river, like the
sky, was aglow, and the people sang softly in the boats, and
still from Bankside came the dying snatches of music, the
soft breath of the cornet, and the tingling touch of the harp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
and the voices of those who sang, and the baying of the
hounds from Paris Gardens.</p>

<p>The early history of the playhouses on the Bank involves
many questions, and may be safely left to the antiquarian
historian. The reader will find most of these
questions raised and settled in a book, already quoted here,
by Mr. T. Fairman Ordish ('Early London Theatres'). It
appears, however, that there were players, if not playhouses,
here as early as 1547. After the death of Henry VIII.
Gardiner proposed to have a solemn dirge in memory of the
King, but, he complained to the Council, the players of
Southwark say that they also will have a 'solemn playe to
trye who shall have most resorts, they in game, or I in
earnest.'</p>

<p>Whether these players had a regular theatre, or whether
they acted in the courtyard of an inn, or whether they had
a moveable stage, I do not know. It is, however, quite certain
that before the end of the sixteenth century there were four
theatres in Bankside&mdash;the <i>Rose</i>, whose site was somewhere
in Rose Alley: the <i>Hope</i> in Bear Garden Lane: the <i>Swan</i> in
Paris Gardens&mdash;that is, on the west side of the Blackfriars
Road, not far from the Bridge: and the <i>Globe</i>. The site of
the Globe is generally allowed to have been at a spot 150
feet south of Park Street, close to the Southwark Bridge
Road, and on the east of it. For twenty years, more or
less, the stream of playgoers was turned steadily and continuously
to the Theatres in Bankside, and poet and player
lived beside the theatre, and the place was the pleasure
resort of the people, and the haunt of sporting men, and the
school of the citizens, in history at least: and the pride and
glory of London for its dramatists, if the people knew:
and the sink and shame of London for the iniquities and
villanies practised there: the debauchery and the shamelessness
of those who lived upon the Bank.</p>

<p>The Plague, not only of 1603 and of 1625, but those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
milder attacks which threatened from time to time were a deadly
enemy to the players, for then the theatre must be closed
and the Bear Garden too, for in crowds there was infection.
Think what it meant to close these places of resort. The
Elizabethan theatres maintained almost as many persons as
our own: there were the players proper&mdash;the Company:
there were the servants 'in the front' and the servants
behind, the 'supers,' the money takers, the boys who went
round selling nuts and cakes, wine and ale, new books and
tobacco: there were the watermen required to carry the
audience to and fro. Why, the shutting of the Theatres
must have thrown out of employ many hundreds of men,
and, if we consider their wives and families, many thousands
of people. Can we wonder if the players, one and all, were
Cavaliers, and were ready to fight for the side which allowed
them their daily bread?</p>

<span class="caption">The Bear Garden and Hope Theatre, 1616</span>
</div>

<p>But Fortune was against them. The Puritanic spirit
prevailed. When the Parliament conquered, the theatres
were doomed. And in 1655, by command of Thomas
Pride, High Sheriff of Surrey, the seven bears of Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
Gardens were shot by a company of soldiers. In the same
year it is mentioned that the Hope Theatre had been
destroyed to make room for tenements.</p>

<p>The profession of actor in a time when the Puritanic
spirit was rapidly growing stronger could not possibly be
held in good repute. There was dancing in it: music:
mockery: merriment: satire: low comedy: all these things the
misguided flock enjoyed and the shepherd deplored. The
Mayor, long before the Theatres were suppressed, would never
allow a theatre to be set up within his jurisdiction: had that
jurisdiction extended beyond the various Bars: had there not,
fortunately, happened to exist certain illogical and absurd
Liberties and Precincts, in which the Mayor had no authority,
there would have been no theatres in the neighbourhood of
London, and therefore no Elizabethan drama, no Shakespeare,
no Ben Jonson, no Massinger, no Fletcher. As things
happened, we have to note the very remarkable fact that
while the popular love for the theatre increased year by year;
while the theatre became the teacher of history, the satirist of
manners, the home of music and of poetry; the ministers and
preachers thundered perpetually against it, yet prevailed not
at all, until the Civil War broke out, and the power fell into
the hands of the Puritans. For instance, one John Field, the
father of one of the most famous players, Nathan Field,
wrote to the Earl of Leicester as early as 1585 reviling him
for having interfered 'on the behalf of evil men as of late you
did for players, to the great griefe of all the godly,' and
adjuring him not to encourage their wickedness, and 'the
abuses that are wont to be nourished by those impure interludes
and plays.' And the same divine, two years later,
wrote an attack upon the theatre in consequence of the accident
at Paris Gardens which has been already mentioned.
The theatre was forcibly suppressed in the Civil War, but it
was never forgotten, and the moment that the Restoration
allowed it was opened again. But to our day the old Puritanism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
continues, in a now feeble and impotent way, to
consider the Theatre as the chosen home of the Devil.</p>

<span class="caption">INTERIOR OF THE OLD SWAN THEATRE</span>
</div>

<p>Nathan Field, though the son of such a father, was ready
to meet all comers in defence of the stage. In 1616 one
Sutton, Preacher at St. Mary Overies, denounced the Theatre
and all connected with it. Field answered him manfully,
telling him plainly that he, the preacher, is disloyal, in preaching
from his pulpit against people who are licensed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
patronised by the King. The players were at all times equal
to the task of covering the preacher with derision; but
derision seldom convinces or converts.</p>

<p>The general opinion of players remains that they have at
all times been a penniless tribe, eating the 'corn in the green;'
borrowing; spending their money in riotous living. This
opinion is not by any means always true. The musician, the
mummer, the dancer, and the tumbler were all regarded much
in the same light; they were despised; they did not fight like
the soldier; they did not produce like the craftsman; they did
not, like the priest, say mass and forgive sins; they did not
heal the sick; they knew no law; their only function in the
world was to amuse; to make men laugh. It is very remarkable
that directly the players ceased to be dependent on
noble lords, as soon as they appealed to the public and
received money from those who came to see them perform,
they became prudent men of business. They may have been a
cheerful tribe; they were, however, well to do, and, so far as can
be learned, a thrifty tribe. They made money, not by writing
plays, nor by acting them, but by being shareholders in
the company with which they played. Burbage, Alleyn,
Heminge, Sly, Field, Schanke, not to speak of Shakespeare,
all appear to have lived in comfort, and to have died
possessed of moderate fortunes.</p>

<p>The poets, certainly, continued, as poets have always
been, penniless and in debt. By the end of the sixteenth
century the earliest of the dramatic poets, Marlowe, Peele,
Nash, Greene&mdash;that turbulent roystering profligate band whom
everybody loved while everybody reproved&mdash;had passed away.
The early extravagance vanished. The later poets, Ben
Jonson, Beaumont, Fletcher, Massinger, led more godly lives.
Yet they were often harassed for want of money. Three of
them, Massinger, Field and Daborne, write to Henslow asking
for an advance of 5<i>l.</i> on the security of a play which is worth
ten pounds in addition to what they have had. All those, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
fact, were poor, and remained poor, who attempted to live by
poetic literature alone.</p>

<p>The poets have had enough attention paid to them: let
us consider the Company of Actors who played at the Globe
and the Rose, the Hope and the Lion, and lived on and near
the Bankside. The books of St. Saviour's (see Rendle's
'Southwark,' App. p. 26) are full of references to the actors
who died and were buried here, whose children were baptised
here or buried here. The name of William Shakespeare, unfortunately,
does not occur. Among the actors, and first and
chief, was Richard Burbage&mdash;like Shakespeare, a Warwickshire
man. In person he was under the middle stature, and
grew fat and scant of breath. But no actor of the time had
so great a power over his audience. It was his father who
built the very first permanent theatre&mdash;called The Theatre at
Shoreditch. In consequence of a dispute with the landlord,
he pulled down the house, carried the timbers across the river
to Bankside, and set up the Globe.</p>

<p>There was Kempe, the low comedian, who succeeded
Tarlton in that line. He was a great dancer: on one occasion
he danced all the way from Norwich to London, taking
nine days for the work: he was accompanied by one Thomas
Sly, who played the tabor and the pipe for him. As he passed
through the villages the girls came running out to dance with
him along the road till he tired them out. He was a fellow
of infinite drollery, with jokes and acting such as pleased
the 'groundlings' well. There was a kind of entertainment
popular at the time called a jig. It was a monologue for
the most part, but might be played by two or more, in which
the words were interrupted by songs and dances: the jig was
like the farce which used to be played after the tragedy. This
worthy lived in Bankside, but I believe there is no record of
his death.</p>

<p>Another excellent player was John Lowin or Lewin. He
also lived in the Liberty of the Clink. But he lived too long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
He survived the suppression of Theatres, and in his old age
had no craft or art or mastery by which to earn his bread
save that which was proscribed. He wrote for assistance to
a patron, and he quoted the lover's words applied to the
beggar:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Silence in love betrays more woe<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than words, though ne'er so witty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beggar that is dumb, you know,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Deserves a double pity.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among the low comedians Robert Armin must not be
forgotten. He attracted Tarlton's attention when a mere
boy. The veteran comedian adopted him and taught him.
I know not whether he, or Kempe, was the true successor to
that unrivalled buffoon. He is described by some rhymester
as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Honest gamesome Robert Armin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tickles the spleen like a harmless vermin.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I have already mentioned Nathan Field the player: he
was also Nathan Field the dramatist. He brought into the
latter profession the carelessness about money that belonged
to the former. There are indications&mdash;only indications, it is
true&mdash;that there was in him something of the temperament of
a Micawber, or a Harold Skimpole, a constitutional inability
to understand the meaning of addition and subtraction or the
translation of money into its equivalent in eating and drinking.
He took a wife when he was no longer quite young, and he
became jealous. Hence the epigram, 'De Agello et Othello:'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Field is, in sooth, an actor: all men know it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is the true Othello of the poet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wonder if 'tis true, as people tell us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That like the character he is most jealous.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If it be so, and many living sweare it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It takes not little from the actor's merit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since, as the Moor is jealous of his wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Field can display the passion to the life.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span></div></div>

<p>Who remembers John Schanke? He, like Kempe and
Armin, carried on the traditions of low comedy. He was
great in the invention of 'jigs.' A notable 'jig' was that
called 'Schanke's Ordinary,' in which several performers took
part. There is an odd story told by Collier of a 'Schanke, a
player.' It was in the year 1642. There came galloping to
London three of the Lord General's officers with the news
that there had been a great battle in which the London
Companies had been cut to pieces, and 20,000 men had
fallen on both sides. They spread their news as they rode
through the villages: they spread it abroad in the city. It
was ascertained on inquiry that there had not been any battle
at all, but that those three men&mdash;Captain Wilson, Lieutenant
Whitney, and one Schanke, a player&mdash;were simply runaways.
Therefore they were all clapped in the Gatehouse, and brought
to undergo punishment according to martial law 'for their
base cowardliness.'</p>

<p>One remarks that the race of comic actors or low comedians
never becomes extinct. That power of always seizing on the
comic side in everything, of always being able to make an
audience laugh throughout a whole piece, is never, happily,
taken away from a world which would be too sad without it.
Great poets do not occur more than once in a century: great
novelists not more than twice: but the low comedian, the
comic man, whose face, whose voice, whose carriage, are as
humorous as his words, never fails us. Tarlton is followed
by Kempe, Kempe by Armin, Armin by Schanke. So Robson
follows Liston, and Toole follows Robson, with lesser
lights besides.</p>

<p>There are many other actors. The painstaking Collier
finds out what parts they played and where they lived. Alas!
He tells us no more. Perhaps there is no more to tell. The
rank and file of the theatrical company are never a very
interesting collection. Underwood, Toovey, Eccleston, Cowley,
Cooke, Sly, Argan&mdash;they are shadows that have long since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
passed out, made an exit, and so an end. They were forgotten
by the audience the day after they were dead. Why
seek to revive their memory when there is not a single solitary
fact to go upon? A bone would be something: out of the
skull of Yorick we might perhaps reconstruct his life, with all
the adventures, love-making, disappointments, distresses and
triumphs.</p>

<p>We know the place where they all lived; the place of a
continual Fair without any booths, yet everything offered for
sale: the music to cheer your heart&mdash;you could command it
had you money in purse; the wine to raise your courage&mdash;you
could call for it; the dancing to charm your eye&mdash;any girl
would dance for you if you paid her; the new play to fill
you with lofty thoughts&mdash;but you must pay for your seat; the
jig to bring you back to the level of earth&mdash;or perhaps a little
lower&mdash;you could buy it; the eyes of Dalilah at the sign of
the Swan in the Hoope were directed to your purse; the
ruffians belonging to the kennels and the bear garden; the
drawers of the taverns and the sack and the tobacco, the
boats and the boatmen, were all at your service. The players
lived in this riot and racket, themselves a part: we catch
glimpses of them, we can discern them amid the crowd:
sometimes one of their women is ducked for a shrew; one of
them is clapped in the Clink Prison: some are haled before
the Bishop for acting in Lent&mdash;these unreasonable people
really object to starving in Lent! And the place and the
people and their manners and customs are deplorable but
delightful; they are picturesque to the highest degree, but
they are equally reprehensible. I wish we could go back four
hundred years and see and listen for ourselves: but with all
our admiration for the Elizabethan drama, I do not think that
I should like to be one of the Show Folk or to live with them
in that jovial colony on the Bankside in the days of the
Globe and the Rose, the Hope and the Swan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span></p>

BELOW BRIDGE</h2>


<p>'Below Bridge' covers Tooley Street and her lanes:
Horselydown, Bermondsey, Rotherhithe, Deptford, Greenwich,
and Woolwich. The railway has ruined one end of
Tooley Street, which is a corruption of St. Olave's Street.
Perhaps it was ruined before the railway appeared at all.
Certainly no one would believe that this dark and narrow
street was once a place of Palaces. The Prior of Lewes had
here, opposite St. Olave's Church, his Inn or Town House: here
the Abbot of St. Augustine had his Inn: and here, we have
seen, was the house of Sir John Fastolf. Here was the
Pilgrim's Way to Bermondsey Rood. Some came across
the bridge; some by boat, which was far more convenient,
to Tooley Stairs; some to Battlebridge Stairs; some to
Pickle Herring Stairs. The way lay along Tooley Street
and by 'Barmsie' Lane through the fields and gardens:
a lovely rural lane. Beyond Tooley Street lies a quarter
bounded on the North by the River, and on the East by St.
Saviour's Dock: a quarter which is certainly the most
industrious in the whole of London. It is called Horselydown,
the derivation of which seems obvious, but derivations
are not to be trusted, however obvious. We may take
it for granted, because we can prove the fact by looking at
Roques' map of 1745, that there were meadows where horses
grazed as soon as the embankment was up, and the ground
drained. There was some kind of common here at one time:
here suicides and persons deprived of Christian rites were
buried. There was also a Fair held at Horselydown. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
industries made their appearance in the eighteenth century,
but they came gradually. It is now a place of most remarkable
variety as regards occupations. All along the river
and the bank of the Dock, formerly Savoy Dock, there are
wharves: inland are bonded warehouses, granaries, leather
warehouses, hide warehouses, hop warehouses, and wool
warehouses. There are tanneries, currieries, fur and skin
dyeing works, breweries, rice mills, mustard mills, pepper
mills, dyeing works, dog's food manufactories, vinegar works,
bottle works, iron foundries, wooden hoop manufactories,
cooperages, roperies, smithies, biscuit manufactories, oil and
colour works, pin manufactories, varnish works, and distilleries.
All this in a district half a mile long and a quarter
of a mile broad. Between the factories and the warehouses
are houses for the workmen and the foremen. On the south
side stands the Church, almost the ugliest Church in London:
next to the Church is, or was, a few years ago, a street which
has something of the look and feeling of a Close.</p>

<p>It is a great pity that in the whole of South London
lying east of the High Street there is not a single beautiful,
or even picturesque Church. Look at them! St. Olave's,
St. John, Horselydown, St. Mary Magdalen, St. Mary,
Rotherhithe, the four oldest churches in the quarter. It
cannot be pretended that these structures inspire veneration
or even respect. You may see drawings of them in Maitland.
St. Olave's was rebuilt in 1737, St. John's, Horselydown, in
1735, St. Mary Magdalen in 1680, and St. Mary, Rotherhithe,
in 1713 on the site of the older church. In 1738 the steeple
was added. The four churches are therefore all examples of
the church architecture of nearly the same period.</p>

<span class="caption">A FETE AT HORSELYDOWN IN 1590

(<i>From the Painting by G. Hoffnagel, at Hatfield</i>)</span>
</div>

<p>Of all the quarters and parts of London that of
Horselydown is the least known and the least visited, except
by those whose business takes them there every day. There is,
in fact, nothing to be seen: the wharves block out the river:
the warehouses darken the streets, the places where people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
live are not interesting: there is not an ancient memory or
association, or any ancient fragment of a building, to make
one desire to visit Horselydown. When we pass the Dock,
we find ourselves in quite a different quarter: the wharves are
arranged along the river wall, called the Bermondsey Wall,
but behind the wharves there are fewer factories and more
people. Alas! poor people! It is a grimy place to live in:
of greenery or garden land there is none. There is not even
any access to the river except by one or two narrow stairs:
the 'works' are those whose near neighbourhood is not generally
desired: places where they make leather and curry it: or
where they make glue or vinegar. Fortunately, however, the
good people of Bermondsey are spared the handling of
tallow, bones, or soap. Things might therefore have been
worse. This is the industrial centre of South London, and
it occupies, including Horselydown, St. Olave's, Bermondsey,
and Rotherhithe, something like a quarter of a million, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
is a good-sized city in itself. On the one side of St. Saviour's
Dock we may step aside to look at two streets, which fifty
years ago represented the lowest kind of vice and brutality,
and the worse kind of human pigsties, Talbot Street and
London Street. The former was taken over by Dickens to
adorn his 'Oliver Twist'&mdash;lugged in, for indeed it does not
belong there.</p>

<p>The condition of the latter is figured in Wilkinson's
'London Illustrated' in the year 1806.</p>

<p>The ugliness of the neighbourhood remains, but some of
the dirt has been washed away.</p>

<p>It seems impossible to create a quarter of workmen's
cottages or residences which shall be beautiful. First there
is the slum with a row of two- or four-roomed cottages in a
narrow court: the windows are broken: the banisters of the
staircase are broken away to be burned: the sanitary appliances
are terrible: the court is a laystall. Some of these
delightful places still survive in Southwark. The next step
is to build streets for working men in places where the ground
is not too valuable. Thus the town of Bromley near Bow
sprang into existence. It consists entirely of monotonous
streets with monotonous houses, all small, all ugly, all built
after the same pattern: the result being dreary and dispiriting.
Then come the model dwelling-houses: the huge barrack, of
which, Bermondsey way, there are enormous stacks, accommodating
the working classes by the hundred thousand. There
is not the smallest attempt at making these places beautiful:
they are simple cubes of grey brick with rows and lines of
windows. Outside they may be models of economy in space.
Once within, they may be models of convenience; but there
is another side. The moral effect of this piling up of family
on family is reported to be injurious in ways not contemplated
by the founders: the quiet folk are terrorised by the rowdy;
the children are demoralised: there are dangers not expected,
and temptations not considered: in a word, the model lodging-houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
of Southwark and Bermondsey are not, in every
respect, adapted to a model population.</p>

<p>It is difficult between London Bridge and Rotherhithe to
get at the river, except at two or three spots where the old
stairs can be approached by a narrow passage. There is an
embankment or terrace: the whole bank is occupied for
commercial purposes: business men do not like strangers on
these wharves: and for all practical purposes the dwellers
below Bridge might just as well be a dozen miles inland. If,
however, the resident of Bermondsey can sometimes&mdash;say, on
Saturday afternoon&mdash;get down to the stairs and look out upon
the river, he will see close at hand, not only the ships and
barges that lie about the wharves, but the grand new Watergate
of London, the most appropriate entrance that could be
devised to the port&mdash;the new Tower Bridge.</p>

<span class="caption">THE OLD ELEPHANT AND CASTLE, 1814</span>
</div>

<p>Where Bermondsey Wall ended and Rotherhithe began
the houses, until fifty years ago, rapidly grew thinner, until
Rotherhithe itself consisted of little more than a single street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
with docks, and stairs, and taverns on the riverside, and on
the other side lanes leading to cottages and cottage gardens.
The Commercial Docks were opened in 1807, but the place
still preserved something of its old character until quite
recently. It consisted of a district round which the river
flowed on the north and east. Like all the country about the
Thames, it was low-lying, and originally a marsh. Even
as late as 1830 it was imperfectly drained, and a good
part of it remained still a marsh. Thus the road, now
called Southwark Park Road&mdash;why could they not leave
the old name, Blue Anchor Road?&mdash;even in 1830 wound
through a marsh covered with ditches and ponds. On the
east side, near the junction of Blue Anchor Road with
Jamaica Row, there was a most remarkable collection of
ponds and islands, ending with a broad stream or ditch running
into the river at Rotherhithe stairs. Other ditches or streams
lay or flowed at will over the levels, making islands which
were approached by bridges. The character of the place was
entirely that of a marsh: in fact, it was the last part of
London where there lingered still the appearance of a marsh.
The names show this. We have The Reed Bed; Providence
Island; the Seven Islands; the West Pond; the East Pond;
Broom Fields; Halfpenny Hatch, repeated more than once.
The numerous Ropewalks scattered about show that the ground
was cheap, and the factories where they make glue, soap,
brimstone, turpentine, white lead, and paper are there, which
require plenty of room and few people to enjoy the smell.</p>

<p>Leaving Rotherhithe, we arrive at a place much more
interesting, namely, Deptford. They have done their best to
spoil Deptford of late years: they have taken away the
old Trinity Almshouses: they have built new streets: but
a good deal of the old Deptford remains. I walked about it
nearly every day for three months some twelve years ago,
reconstructing the Deptford of 1750 from the Deptford of
1886. It is like reconstructing the face in youth from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
portrait in middle life. I succeeded at last, to my own satisfaction,
and, I hope, to the satisfaction of my readers when
the eighteenth-century Deptford appeared as the background
of a novel. It was not a very big place: it consisted chiefly
of an old church in the lower part of the town, and a new
church in the upper part: there were two almshouses: there
was the Hall where the Brethren of the Trinity House
assembled every year before their service at St. Nicolas and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
their feast at their house on Tower Hill. The town was full
of sailors and naval officers: the latter were not remarkable for
the finicking ways of the beaux their contemporaries: on the
contrary, they despised such ways&mdash;'their fashions I hate, like
a pig in a gate.' When they were young they made love all
the time they were ashore, except when they were drinking
and taking tobacco at the tavern&mdash;these occupations, truly,
left the honest fellows less time for love than might have been
expected. There were officers' taverns and seamen's taverns:
rum, however, was the favourite drink at both. And, really,
it would surprise you to hear the songs they sang, and to
observe the cheerfulness with which they put up with everything:
favouritism: long and hopeless service in the lower
ranks: bad food on board: long years of foreign service: and
for all the gallantry that these brave fellows showed in service
not a word of thanks: not a hint at promotion.</p>

<p>The Town consisted mostly of a single street: there were
shops, but poor things: there was a market: fruit and vegetables
were brought in from the country round: within a few
steps of the town one was in the loveliest country, with the
Ravensbourne flowing between meadows and under the
branches of willows and of alders.</p>

<p>The dockyard of Deptford was founded by Henry the
Eighth, and continued till 1869. It was at Deptford that
most of the ships were built for the Royal Navy in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries: it was here that Drake's
ship, the <i>Golden Hind</i>, in which he had made his voyage
round the world, was laid up, her cabin turned into a place of
entertainment. She remained here, an object of pilgrimage
for the Londoners, for many years. She was a good deal cut
about, because everybody wanted to carry away a piece of
her. At last she was suffered to fall to pieces. One pious
archæologist got a chair made out of her timbers and presented
it to the Bodleian Library.</p>

<p>Pepys was often at Deptford in his capacity of Secretary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
of the Admiralty. 'Up and down the yard all the
morning, and seeing the seamen exercise, which they do
already very handsomely. Then to dinner.... After dinner
and taking our leave of the officers of the yard, we walked to
the waterside, and on our way walked into the ropeyard,
where I had a look into the tarhouses and other places, and
took great notice of all the several works belonging to the
making of a cable.'</p>

<p>It was at Deptford that Pepys visited Lady Sandwich,
'where I stood with great pleasure an hour or two by her
bedside, she lying prettily in bed.' During the plague year,
when he and his wife were staying at Woolwich, he goes over
to Deptford nearly every day, and was continually feasting
with his friends and always 'very merry,' though the plague
was slaying its thousands only a mile or two away.</p>

<p>Another visitor to Deptford who left a lasting memory was
Peter the Great, who stayed here in 1698, studying ship architecture.
The people of the town had the satisfaction of seeing
the Czar of Muscovy&mdash;not quite so great a man then as he is
now&mdash;smoking a pipe of tobacco and drinking brandy in
their taverns every evening. By day they might see him
working among the dockyard men at the various parts of a
ship and its gear.</p>

<p>The most interesting person, however, who is connected
with the annals of Deptford is certainly John Evelyn.</p>

<p>Evelyn was not a great writer, nor a great scholar, nor a
great statesman: he was not great in anything that he did:
yet his memory remains, and will remain long after that of
much stronger men has been forgotten. He wrote a great
deal, and since some of his writings survive after three
hundred years it is manifest that he must have written well.
He was a strong royalist who knew how to take care of his
own skin. In order to avoid being dragged into the army
and fighting for the cause which he loved, he went abroad
and travelled in Europe for four years, during which time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
royal cause fell to pieces, and those who fought for it were
ruined. In 1647 he came home again; in 1649 he went back
to France, where he stayed till 1652. By this time he had
made many discoveries and observations on art and antiquities.
He also married a wife, the daughter of Charles's
ambassador at Paris. Through his wife he obtained possession
of Sayes Court, Deptford, where, with a few breaks, one
of which was to allow Peter the Great to use the house, he
lived till nearly the end of his life. He was one of the
founders and first Fellows of the Royal Society: he was a
member of many commissions: he was the first Treasurer of
Queen Mary's new naval hospital, and held many other offices.</p>

<p>In quite a brief note Pepys sums up the character and
the accomplishments of this estimable man:</p>

<p>'Nov. 5, 1665. By water to Deptford, and here made a
visit to Mr. Evelyn, who among many other things showed me
most excellent painting in little: in distemper; in Indian
ink; water colours; graving: and above all, the whole secret
of mezzotinto, and the manner of it, which is very pretty,
and good things done with it. He read to me very much also
of his discourse he hath been many years and now is about,
about Gardening, which will be a most noble and pleasant
piece. He read me part of a play or two of his making;
very good, but not as he conceits them, I think, to be. He
showed me his "Hortus Hyemalis," leaves laid up in a book
of several plants kept dry, which preserve colour, however,
and look very finely, better than a Herball. In fine, a most
excellent person he is, and must be allowed a little for
conceitedness; but he may well be so, being a man so
much above others.'</p>

<p>His memory survives on account of the personal character
of the man which is revealed in his works, and of the high
opinion in which he was held. 'A typical instance,' says his
latest biographer ('Dict, of Nat. Biog.'), 'of the accomplished
and public-spirited country gentleman of the Restoration, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
pious and devoted member of the Church of England, and a
staunch loyalist in spite of his grave disapproval of the
manners of the court.' Above all things, it might be added,
he was a gardener, and all gardeners are amiable and all
gardeners are personally popular.</p>

<p>Of Greenwich Palace I have already spoken. There is
little else in Greenwich except the Palace or Hospital. The
Almshouse known as Norfolk College must not be forgotten,
however. It is on the east side of the Hospital, and stands
behind a stone terrace, overlooking the river. The College
consists of a quadrangle containing a chapel and a small
hall or common room, with gardens at the back. This kind
of almshouse is common, but it is difficult to build it so that
it shall not be beautiful. Norfolk College is quite a beautiful
place. Finer and larger is Morden College, up the hill,
designed for decayed merchants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span></p>

<p>This is the end of London: a few yards beyond Norfolk
College the houses stop suddenly: on the tongue of land
projecting north formed by a loop of the river there are
hardly any houses at all: the place is a dreary flat as far
as Woolwich. The London County Council limits include
Woolwich and Plumstead; but that broad area covered
by continuous houses which begins at Battersea ends at
Greenwich.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span></p>

<br />
THE LATER SANCTUARY</h2>


<p>The Sanctuary created and crossed by the Church for the
refuge of those who had fallen into temptation became, as
we know, the resort of the rogue, the murderer, and the
habitual criminal. Within the precincts of St.-Martin's-le-Grand
were carried on with impunity all the trades and
methods of producing things counterfeit. The Sanctuary of
Westminster was a scandal and a disgrace. These places
had been finally abolished after much trouble: the City
officers could march their rogues to Newgate without fear
of a rescue from St. Martin's. The people of Westminster
could lie down at night without fear of housebreakers
from Sanctuary. At the same time the custom of holding
and seeking sanctuary was too deep-rooted to be quickly
abolished. Perhaps there was something comfortable in the
thought that there should be a place, however small, where
the officers of the law were not admitted, and where rogues
should be unmolested. It was a loophole for repentance,
perhaps: it was a gleam of sunshine on the path of the outlaw.
So the custom was continued well into the eighteenth
century. In this chapter I am going to recall the memory
of these later Sanctuaries. As may be imagined, literature
says little about them. But it says enough to show that there
were places dotted about London which served all the purposes
of the old sanctuaries without the restraints of ecclesiastical
government: in fact, there was no government, except on
purely democratic principles. In these places lived rogues
and villains of all kinds: here the thief-taker came to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
his man&mdash;observe that this functionary was admitted; the
thief-taker ventured where the sheriff's officer could not.
Why was this? Because the London rogue had a sense of
justice: no man could expect to go on for ever: when a
man's time was up, let him give place to his successor. The
thief-taker, therefore, was a recognised official: it was his
duty to assign to every man his proper length of rope. This
allowance expended, it was the duty of the rogue to get up
when he was called, go away quietly with the thief-taker, and
get hanged in due course. Otherwise, there would have been
no living to be made by the rogues on account of the competition
of numbers. The name of Alsatia had been long
forgotten, but the asylum still remained.</p>

<p>In the 'Fortunes of Nigel' we are made acquainted with
the Alsatia of Fleet Street. There were other places equally
secure for rogues, besides Alsatia. Such were Whetstone
Park in Lincoln's Inn Fields; Fullwood's Rents, Holborn;
Milford Lane, Strand; Montagu Close, Southwark; and others.
All these were gradually extinguished; not by any summary
procedure; not by turning out the rogues and forcing them
to scatter; not by marching off the whole population to
prison; but by the slower and more gradual process of
transformation. This process began when the parts and
places around became respectable. There is something
chilling and repellent to the common rogue about the
proximity of respectability: he does not like to be in its
neighbourhood: in this way these degenerate and unlawful
sanctuaries gradually fell into decay. One alone remained,
when all the others had disappeared. It was in that part of
Southwark&mdash;that part which is still a slum&mdash;called Mint
Street, nearly opposite St. George's Church in the High
Street. This street, with its alleys and courts, was inhabited
by as villainous a collection as even the eighteenth century,
which in point of villains was rich beyond its predecessors,
could not equal. They had retreated here from their former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
haunt in Montagu Close, as to a last fortress, which was not yet
besieged. They lived in perfect safety here: no writ could
be served on them: no arrest could be made: the only person
they had to fear was, as said above, the thief-taker.</p>

<p>The annals of this Sanctuary were never, unfortunately,
kept; it is impossible to ascertain what illustrious criminals
were here housed and for how long. There are, however, one
or two little histories of the Mint which will serve to show
us at once the public spirit, the courage, and the immunity
with which the people of the later Sanctuary lived and
acted.</p>

<p>The first story belongs to the year 1715. The case of
Dormer <i>v.</i> Dormer and Jones came on for hearing at
Westminster Hall. It was a divorce case, in which the
co-respondent had been a footman in the plaintiff's house.
There seems to have been no defence, practically. The
verdict of the Jury was for the plaintiff, with 5,000<i>l.</i> damages.
Now, consider for a moment what that verdict meant. In
these days, when a defendant without any private means at
all is mulcted in damages and costs, whether of 5,000<i>l.</i> or of
100<i>l.</i>, he simply smiles. He is not in the least degree affected.
Nothing worse than bankruptcy can happen to him, and
when a man has nothing bankruptcy presents few terrors.
In Portugal Street <i>subridet vacuus viator</i>&mdash;the insolvent
pilgrim smiles cheerfully. But in those days it was very
different. To inflict damages of 5,000<i>l.</i> meant simply that
the Jury considered the case one in which the defendant, who
could not be tried in the criminal courts, could only be
adequately punished by being locked up for the whole of his
remaining days in a debtor's prison, where, since he was only
a footman whose relations were probably unable to assist him
and certainly unable to maintain him, he would speedily take
his place on the common side, and there he would be slowly
done to death by insufficient food and insufficient clothing,
by privation, cold, fever and misery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span></p>

<p>The Jury therefore gave this verdict with deliberate
intention. It meant prison and slow starvation and insufficient
warmth, and so everybody instantly understood,
including Mr. Jones himself. In a moment the officers would
have laid hands upon the unhappy but undeserving footman.
But he was too quick for them: he turned: he fled: he hurled
himself down Westminster Hall through the crowd of lawyers,
witnesses, booksellers, glovesellers, and visitors: he tore
across New Palace Yard, now pursued by the officers: he
made for the 'Bridge,' that is, the pier so called, for as yet
there was no Bridge: he jumped into the first boat and
shoved off. When the bailiffs arrived breathless at the Stairs,
they saw their prisoner already half way across the river.
They too jumped into a boat: for some reason or other&mdash;one
knows not why&mdash;it was most unlucky&mdash;their boat took a
long time to get off: something was wrong with the painter:
the ropes were knotted: the stretchers wanted to be set right:
the oars were on the wrong sides: the men were slow in
getting off their coats: finally, when she was cast loose the
boat proved to be another Noah's Ark for creeping slowly
over the face of the waters. Jones therefore got safely ashore
on the other side, and the bailiffs turned back with a good
deal of cursing. Once ashore, the fugitive made straight to
Mint Street, as to a Levitical City which was also a City of
Refuge. I know not what became of him afterwards. It
was a hive where all the bees were busy. Jones could not
eat the bread of idleness: he therefore, one may certainly
conclude, became a rogue by profession and in due course
met his fate bravely with white ribbons round his cap, an
orange in one hand, a Prayer-book in the other, and a large
nosegay in his shirt front.</p>

<p>Here is another story of the same Eighteenth Century
Sanctuary. It will seem incredible that the Executive should
have been so incapable, but the story is literally true.</p>

<span class="caption">MINT STREET, BOROUGH</span>
</div>

<p>Things being in so satisfactory and settled a condition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
the Law being so triumphantly defied, at the Mint in Southwark,
some of the residents or collegians naturally desired to
go farther afield, and to establish more Sanctuaries or Law-defying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
colonies on the other side of the river, which was
reported to be ripe for these settlements. No reports of
Meetings, Proceedings, and Resolutions held and passed on
the subject have come down to us. However, that matters
very little. Every great movement, we know, is the work of
one man. Therefore there arose a Prophet&mdash;the Prophet as
Rogue. He perceived, understood, and presently began to
preach that a 'long felt want'&mdash;call it rather a 'need'&mdash;existed,
which it was his duty to supply. The old Sanctuaries
of North London, he pointed out, had fallen into decay.
Alsatia was deplorably respectable: bailiffs had been seen in
Milford Lane: the trade of counterfeit rings was no longer
carried on in St. Martin's. And, though there were certainly
taverns in Clerkenwell which bailiffs regarded with a useful
respect, it could not be denied that London needed a new
Sanctuary. This need he called upon his friends and fellow-residents
in the Mint to supply. He set before his hearers
with burning eloquence&mdash;I am sure it was burning&mdash;a Vision
of a New London, Purged; Purified; without honesty; without
morals; without law; with neither gallows, pillory, whipping
post, or stocks: a City entirely in the hands of Rogues who
would compel all the conquered City to work for them: would
seize on all property and would live triumphantly happy with
complete control over all the Prisons. To make a beginning
of this Millennium, he proposed, by means of colonies from the
Mint, to plant all London with Sanctuaries until, in fulness of
time, the City should become one huge Sanctuary, where debts
would never be collected, and robbery and murder would
never be punished.</p>

<p>They chose for their new settlement a piece of ground on
the east of Tower Hill, where Cable Street is now. They laid
down their boundaries: they called the place the New Mint:
they said, 'Within these limits there shall be no arrest.' This
new law they communicated fairly and plainly, because everything
was above board, to all the catchpoles. They then sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
down as in an impregnable fortress. Remember, that if there
were no police, such as we now understand by the word, they
were close to the soldiers of the Tower, who might have been
called in to disperse this lawless establishment. However,
nothing at all was done. They sat down triumphant.
Presently&mdash;I know not how long afterwards&mdash;a bailiff was
actually found to disregard the warning. You will hardly
believe that this rash and audacious person ventured to
arrest a New Minter within the Precincts!</p>

<p>Then the colonists arose and formed into column: they
called for music: preceded by a band of what used to be
called the Whifflers, they marched in a procession, four
abreast, quietly, calmly, but with settled purpose in their
gallant and resolute faces: they carried a banner, yea, the
Flag of Unrighteousness: they marched straight to the house
of the offender, who, for his part, was so foolish as not to run
away. It is, however, a weakness common to Catchpoles
that they always put their trust in the Law. They arrested
that Catchpole: they led him to the place where he had
offended: and there they made an example of him. They
tore away every shred of clothing from him: they flogged him
all over with brooms and thorny brambles: they gave him a
thousand lashes, so that there was not a whole inch of skin
left upon him: they dragged him through filthy ponds and laystalls:
they took him out and flogged him again: they tried to
flog the life out of the poor wretch but failed, for he survived:
then they dragged him again through the filth: at last they
suffered him, bleeding and naked, to crawl home as best he
might. I am sorry to say that I have no information as to
the end of the New Mint adventure; but it certainly appears
that no one was punished for this outrage, and that no
attempt even was made to punish anyone. Perhaps the
memory of that gallant deed still lingers in Cable Lane: but
I have not ventured to inquire of the still rude and independent
freemen, its present residents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span></p>

<br />
<br />
IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</h2>


<p>If we look at a map of South London compiled at any time
during the eighteenth century it is surprising to observe how
little the place had grown since the fifteenth. There runs, as
of old, the Causeway at right angles to the Embankment.
On either side of the Causeway or High Street or St. Margaret's
Hill, run off right and left a few narrow streets: the continuity
of houses is broken by St. George's Church, south of
which, although there are, here and there, detached houses
and even rows of houses or terraces, there are open fields,
streams, ponds and gardens. St. George's Fields, crossed by
paths, are broad and open fields stretching out westward till
they join Lambeth Marsh. St. Margaret's Church has long
since vanished: he who knows the old maps can still put his
finger on the site, but its burial ground has wholly disappeared.
There are four old churches in Southwark proper:
St. George's, St. Saviour's, St. Thomas's, and St. Olave's. On
the east are the churches of Bermondsey and Rotherhithe, not
to speak of Deptford: on the west is Lambeth Church: on
the south are the churches of Newington and Kennington.
As for other institutions, there are the two great hospitals
St. Thomas's and Guy's almost side by side: and there are
the prisons, that of the King's Bench, the Marshalsea and the
White Lyon. They were all on the east side of the street
until 1756, when the King's Bench Prison was removed across
the road nearly opposite to St. George's. Some time after
the Marshalsea was moved further south on the site of the old
White Lyon and including that ancient Clink. The old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
Clink on Bankside had vanished. But the Borough Compter
was still flourishing&mdash;a grimy, filthy, fever-stricken place.</p>

<span class="caption">OLD HOUSE, STONEY STREET, SOUTHWARK</span>
</div>

<p>At the back of the houses and narrow streets to east and
west, the fields began with open ditches or sewers and sluggish
streams. 'Snow's' Fields on the east were as well known as
St. George's in the West. 'Long Lane' ran from St. George's
to Bermondsey Church: it contained a few houses: Bermondsey
Lane, commonly called Barmsie, ran from the old
cross to the same church: it was already a street of houses.
The most crowded part of Southwark proper was the street
called Tooley or St. Olave's, the most ancient street in the
Borough, originally built upon the Embankment, the Thames<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
Street of South London. Here, in the eighteenth century,
there were no vestiges left of the former palaces: everything
had gone except a crypt or a vault: at every step one
came upon the entrance to a court, narrow, mean and squalid:
these courts remain, also narrow, mean and squalid, to the
present day. There were no places in London, unless in the
neighbourhood of Hermitage Street, Wapping, where human
creatures had to pig together in such horrible conditions.
There was no water supply to these courts: there was no
lighting: there was no paving, not even with the round
cobbles which they still called paving.</p>

<p>On the west side of the High Street, of which a map is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
given on p. <a href="#Page_85">85</a> of this volume, beyond St. Saviour's, the nave
of which was fast falling into ruins, came Bankside. Alas!
It was deserted: not a single theatre was left: not a baiting
Place: not a Bear to bait: there was no longer a poet or an
actor or a musician on Bankside: there were no more evenings
at the Falcon: there was no longer heard the tinkling of the
guitar, and the scraping of the violin. South of Bankside lay
two broad gardens, side by side: one called Pye Garden; and
the other, west of Winchester House, was called Winchester
Park. Paris Gardens were no more. Blackfriars Bridge Road, in
which there were as yet but few houses, had been cut ruthlessly
right through the middle of the old Gardens; the trees,
once so thick and close, had been laid low, but there were still
kitchen gardens. South of the Gardens, with an interval of
a few side streets, we come upon St. George's Fields, and
on the west of these fields upon Lambeth Marsh, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
cut up into ropewalks, tenter grounds, nurseries, and kitchen
gardens. Where Waterloo Station now stands were Cuper's
Gardens: there were half a dozen Pleasure Gardens, of which
more anon: there were turnpikes wherever two roads met.
But perhaps the most remarkable feature of this quarter in
the last century was the immense number of streams and
ditches and ponds: most of these were little better than open
sewers: complaints were common of the pollution of these
streams&mdash;but it was in vain: people will always throw everything
that has to be ejected into the nearest running water if
they can. One wants the map in order to understand how
numerous were these streams. There was one murky brook
which ran along the backs of all the houses on the east side
of High Street&mdash;the prisoners of the Marshalsea and the
King's Bench grumbled about it continually: another corresponding
stream ran behind the west side of High Street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
Maiden Lane, now called Park Lane, rejoiced in one: Gravel
Lane, more blessed still, was happy with a ditch or stream on
each side: Dirty Lane had one: another ran along Bandy
Leg Walk: other streams flowed, or crept, or crawled, across
Lambeth Marsh and St. George's Fields. Where there were
no houses, and therefore no pollutions, the streams of this
broad marsh, lying beneath and between the orchards,
fringing the gardens, and crossing the open fields, were a
pleasant feature, though they had no stones to prattle over,
but only the dark peaty <i>humus</i> of the marsh: and the water
channels necessitated frequent little rustic bridges which were
sometimes picturesque. Some of the streams again were of
considerable size, especially that called 'The Shore' by
Roques. It was also called the Effra. Along the banks of
this stream stood here and there cottages, having little
gardens in front and rustic bridges across the stream. But
whether these streams ran or whether they crawled, behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
or beside the crowded houses they were foul and fetid and
charged with all the things which should be buried away or
burned way: they were laden with fevers and malaria and
'putrid' sore throat.</p>

<p>The High Street of Southwark is now a crowded
thoroughfare, because it is the main artery of a town containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
a population of many hundreds of thousands. In the
last century it was quite as animated because it was one of
the main arteries by which London was in communication
with the country. An immense number of coaches, carts,
waggons, and 'caravans' passed every day up and down the
High Street, some stopping or starting in Southwark itself;
some going over London Bridge to their destination in the
City. The coach of the first half of the century can be
restored from Hogarth. That of the latter half of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
century was in all respects like the revived coaches of the
present day, adapted for rapid travelling along a smooth
road. The carts were carriers' carts on two wheels with a
tilt or cover; they carried parcels and small packages, and
on occasions, but not always, one or two passengers. The
waggons, which carried heavy goods and passengers not in a
hurry, were also covered with a tilt; their broad wheels and
capacious interior can be restored, as well as the coach, from
that most trustworthy painter of his own time. As for the
caravans, I am in some doubt. I suppose, however, that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
caravan was then what it is now, in which case it was an
elementary Pullman's car, in which people and their effects
were drawn slowly along the road, in a four-wheeled covered
cart. Perhaps the passengers slept in the car at night, drawn
up by the roadside, like the gipsies. But of this theory I
have no kind of proof.</p>

<p>From the Borough alone, without counting the vehicles
which passed through to or from the City, there were sent
out, every week, one hundred and forty-three stage coaches:
one hundred and twenty-one waggons: and one hundred and
ninety-six carts and caravans. And, of course, the same
number came back every week. There was a continual succession
of departures and arrivals; all day long, one after the
other, the stage coaches came galloping up each to its own
inn; while they were still far away the people of the inn
knew when their own coach was coming by the tune played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
on the guard's bugle: the High Street, in fact, was like a
railway terminus, where trains are arriving and leaving all
day long.</p>

<span class="caption">The Old Town Hall, Southwark</span>
</div>

<p>I am quite sure that we have no idea at all of the life and
animation at a London inn when the stages were started and
when they arrived. With as much method, and as quickly
as the railway porters clear out the luggage and get rid of
the train, the horses were taken out: the passengers got
down: the coachman looked inside for his perquisites in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
shape of anything forgotten and left behind: the luggage
was laid out: the porters seized it and carried it off to the
hackney coach outside: the passengers followed their luggage:
and the courtyard was ready for the next coach. Outside
the courtyard there hung about, all day long, whole companies
of thieves waiting for the chance of carrying off something
unconsidered or forgotten. Generally, they stood in with the
stable boys and the porters, who, for a trifle, were good
enough to shut their eyes. If a trunk was seen to lie unclaimed,
one of them came bustling in. 'Give us a hand,
Jack,' he cried to one of the porters, as if he had been ordered
to call for and bring away that trunk. A confederate or two
stood at the door to trip up a pursuer or a proprietor, if there
was one, and in a moment man and box would be lost to
sight in a neighbouring court. Pickpockets as well abounded
about the courtyards: outside were houses filled with disorderly
folk of all kinds waiting to entrap and to tempt
and to rob the country bumpkin. There was the couple
ready with the confidence trick: the generous and hospitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
gentleman to welcome the country lad: there was the lady
of the ready smile: and the taverns with the doors open to
all. The numbers of coaches and waggons I have given refer
to Southwark alone, and to the conveyances which belonged
to the inns up and down in the High Street. But a great
many more came across the bridge from the City daily.
Now, if we are considering the traffic and animation of the
roads leading to the City, remember that the High Street,
Borough, was only one of many main lines of traffic. There
were, besides, the roads to the North: to the Eastern
counties: to the Midlands: to the West: and to the Northwest.
Day and night the roads all round London were
thronged with these coaches, carts, caravans, and waggons:
but these vehicles were for ordinary folk only: for tradesmen,
attorneys, clergymen, farmers, riders (that is, commercial
travellers) and servants: a nobleman or a country gentleman
scorned to travel in a public conveyance: he came up to
London, if not in his own coach, then in a post-chaise, of
which there were thousands on the road. Add to these the
horsemen, of whom there were an immense number riding
from place to place: add, further, the long droves of cattle,
sheep and pigs: the cattle, however, to save their feet and to
keep them in condition, were mostly taken along 'drives' by
the roadside, where the ground was soft. One of these can
still be seen on the other side of Hampstead. Pedestrians
there were also by thousands: soldiers: sailors: gipsies:
strolling actors: tinkers and tramps&mdash;the land was full of
tramps: in a word the roads near London were crowded and
animated and full of adventure, character, incident, and
picturesqueness: indeed, the dismal and deserted condition
of the modern road makes it difficult for us to realise the
crowds and the life of the road in the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Of society in the Borough there is little information to be
procured. The place had, however, its better class. One
infers so much from the fact that there were Assembly Rooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
in the High Street, and that a Borough Assembly was held
during the winter on stated days, at which the fashion and
aristocracy of the place were gathered together. I have
gathered one anecdote alone concerning this Assembly. It
is of an accident.</p>

</div>

<p>The company were assembled: the Minuets had begun:
the orchestra was in full play: the ladies were dressed in
their finest: hoops were swinging: towering heads were
nodding: the gentlemen were splendid in pale blue satin and
in pink, when suddenly the doors, which stood on the level of
the street, were pushed open, and a dozen oxen came running
in one after the other. The company parted right and left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">{262}</a></span>
falling over benches and each other: the creatures, terrified
by the light and the shrieks of the ladies, began to point
threatening horns: nobody dared to drive them out till the
'well-known'&mdash;the phrase is pathetic, because fame is so
short-lived&mdash;the 'well-known' Mrs. A. advanced, and with a
brandishing of her apron and the magic of a 'Shoo! Shoo!'
persuaded the animals to leave the place. Then who shall
tell of the raising of fallen and fainting damsels? Who shall
speak of the rending of skirts and embroidered petticoats?
Who can describe the deplorable damage to the heads? And
who can adequately celebrate the gallantry of the men when
there was no more danger? Bowls of punch, I am pleased
to record, were quickly administered as a restorative: and
after certain necessary repairs to the heads and the sewing
up of torn skirts, the wounded spirits of the company revived,
and the ball proceeded.</p>

<p>Another indication of society in Southwark is the fact
that on one occasion&mdash;perhaps on more than one occasion&mdash;when
the black footmen of London resolved on holding an
Assembly of their own, it was in the Borough that they held
it. And a very interesting evening it must have proved, had
we any record of the proceedings. Perhaps black cooks were
found to dance with black footmen.</p>

<p>Since it contained the headquarters of so many stage
coaches, carts and waggons, the High Street was bound to
contain, as well, many houses of entertainment, if only as
stables for the horses and accommodation for the drivers and
grooms. The inns of Southwark, however, were far more
ancient than the stage coaches. We have seen already that
from the earliest times of trade the southern suburb was the
place where merchants and those who brought produce of all
kinds to London out of the south country put up their teams
of pack-horses and their goods, and found bed and board and
company for themselves. We have also seen how the inns of
Southwark were used as gathering places and starting places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
for the Pilgrims bound for St. Thomas's Shrine, Canterbury.
The mediæval inn was not much like that of later times. It contained
a common hall and a common dormitory, with another
for women. There was also a covered place for goods, and
stables for horses. A small specimen of a fifteenth-century
inn survives at Aylesbury: the hall, quite a small room, is
very well preserved. That of the Tabard must have been much
larger, in order to accommodate so large a company. The
quaint old inns, so long the delight of the artist, now nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
all gone, were not earlier than the sixteenth or seventeenth
century. They consisted of a large open courtyard filled
with waggons and vehicles of all kinds, surrounded by
galleries, at the back of which were bedrooms, and other
chambers opening from the gallery. On the ground floor
were the kitchens, dining-rooms, and private sitting-rooms.
There was generally a large room for public dinners and
other occasions. The inns of Southwark formed, so long as
they stood, the most picturesque part of modern Southwark.
Scarcely anything now remains of them, the George alone preserving
anything of its ancient picturesqueness. The reader
who desires a closer acquaintance with these inns is referred to
Mr. Philip Norman's exquisitely illustrated book, which presents
in a lasting form the vanished glories of the High Street.</p>

<p>To speak of these inns is like entering upon a historical
catalogue. There are so many of them, and the associations
connected with them carry one away into so many directions
and land him into many strange corners of history.</p>

<p>At the south end of London Bridge, and on the west side
of it, stood a tavern called the 'Bear at the Bridge Foot.' It
was built in the year 1319 by one Thomas Drinkwater,
taverner of London. In Riley's 'Memorials' may be found
a lease of this house by the proprietor to one James Beauflur.
The lease is for six years. James Beauflur is to pay no rent,
because he has advanced money to Thomas Drinkwater to
help in the building. James is, in fact, to act as manager of
a 'tied' house. Thomas Drinkwater will furnish all the wine,
and will keep an exact account of the same and will have a
settlement twice a year. Thomas will also complete the furniture
of the house with 'hanaps,' that is, handled mugs of
silver and of wood, with curtains, clothes, and everything else
necessary for the proper conduct of a tavern.</p>

<span class="caption">ALLEN ROPEWALK, SOUTHWARK</span>

<p>One hopes that James Beauflur made the tavern pay.
This was the commencement of a long and singularly prosperous
inn. It became one of the most famous inns of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
London, and one of the most popular for dinners. Hither
came the Churchwardens and vestry of St. Olave's to feast at
the expense of the parish as long as feasts were allowed. Some
of the bills of these dinners have been preserved among the
papers of St. Saviour's. Rendle the antiquary and historian
of Southwark gives one:</p>

<p>Among the names of persons connected with the tavern
must be noticed that of the Duke of Norfolk&mdash;'Jockey of
Norfolk'&mdash;in 1463. Two hundred years later, one Cornelius
Cooke, late a Colonel in Cromwell's army and a commissioner
for the sale of the King's lands, enters upon a new
sphere of usefulness by turning landlord of the Bear at the
Bridge Foot. Samuel Pepys records several visits paid to the
tavern. From this house the Duke of Richmond carried off
Miss Stewart. It was pulled down in 1761, when the end of
the bridge was widened. I need not catalogue the whole long
list of the Southwark inns: you may find them all enumerated
in Rendle's book, but mention may be made of the more
important. Some of them, it will be seen, had been in more
ancient times the town houses of great people&mdash;Bishops,
Abbots and nobles. Other town houses, those off the highway
of trade, having been deserted by their former occupants,
fell upon evil times, went down in the world, even became
mere tenements. This happened to Sir John Fastolf's
house, and to the house of the Prior of Lewes, and to many
others. Those standing in the highway, whither came all the
merchants; whither came all the waggons; became transformed,
and proved more valuable property as inns than as
residences.</p>

<p>Thus, in Foul Lane, now just south of St. Mary Overies,
was the entrance to the Green Dragon Inn. This inn was
anciently the town house of the Cobhams. This family left
Southwark, and the house, with some alterations, became an
Inn. When carriers began to ply between London and the
country towns, Tunbridge was connected by a carrier's cart
with the Green Dragon. Early in the eighteenth century it
became the Southwark post-office. Another and a much
more important inn for carriers and waggons was the King's
Head. Taylor, the Water Poet, says that 'carriers come into
the Borough of Southwark out of the counties of Kent,
Sussex, and Surrey: from Reigate to the Falcon: from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
Tunbridge, Seavenoks, and Staplehurst to the Katherine
Wheel, and others from Sussex thither; Dorking and Ledderhead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
to the Greyhound: some to the Spurre, the George, the
King's Head: some lodge at the Tabbard or Talbot: many,
far and wide, are to be had almost daily at the White Hart.'</p>

<p>The White Hart is, if possible, a more historical inn than
Chaucer's Tabard itself. It was the headquarters of Jack
Cade, as has already been related in <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">chapter vi</a>. In front of
this inn one Hawarden was beheaded: and also in front of
this inn the headless body of Lord Say, after being dragged
at the horsetail from the Standard at Chepe, was cut up in
quarters, which were displayed in various places in order to
strike terror into the minds of the people.</p>

<span class="caption">THE OLD TABARD INN, SOUTHWARK</span>
</div>

<p>I have spoken sufficiently of Chaucer already. The
Tabard Inn, from which the famous Company set out, was
named after the ornamented coat or jacket worn by Kings at
Coronations, and by heralds, or even by ordinary persons.
In the fourteenth century it was the town house of the Abbot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
of Hyde, Winchester. Does this mean that the Abbot allowed
the place to be used as an ordinary inn? It is clear that
Chaucer speaks of it as an ordinary inn. Yet in 1307 the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
Bishop of Winchester licenses a chapel at the Abbot's Hospitium
in the Parish of St. Margaret, Southwark. At the
Dissolution it is surrendered as 'a hostelry called the Taberd,
the Abbot's place, the Abbot's stable, the garden belonging,
a dung place leading to the ditch going to the Thames.' It
is explained in Spight's 'Chaucer,' 1598, that the old Tabard
had much decayed, but that it had been repaired 'with the
Abbot's house adjoining.' Until the inn was finally pulled
down, a room used to be shown as that in which Chaucer's
Company assembled. This, however, was not the room,
though it may have been rebuilt on the site of the old room.
For on Friday, May 26, 1676, a destructive fire broke out,
which raged over a large part of the Borough and destroyed
the Queen's Head, the Talbot, the George, the White Hart,
the King's Head, the Green Dragon, the Borough Compter,
the Meat Market, and about 500 houses. St. Thomas's Hospital
was saved by a change of wind, which also seems to
have saved St. Mary Overies.</p>

<p>Walk with me from the Bridge head southwards, noting
the Inns first on the right or the west, and then on the left
or east.</p>

<p>We have, first, the Bear on Bridge Head: then, before
getting to Ford Lane, the Bull's Head: opposite the market
place, the Goat: next the Clement. Opposite St. George's
Church we cross over, and are on the east side, going north
again: here we have a succession of Inns: the Half Moon:
the Blue Maid and the Mermaid: the Nag's Head: the
Spur: the Christopher: the Cross Keys: the Tabard: the
George: the White Hart: the King's Head: the Black
Swan: the Boar's Head. There is a pleasing atmosphere
of business mixed with festivity about this street of inns and
courtyards: of stables and grooms: of drivers and guards: of
coaches and waggons: of merchants and middlemen: of
country squires come up on business, with the hope of combining
a little pleasure amongst the excitements of the town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
with a profitable deal or two. There is the smell of roast
meats hanging about the courtyards of the inns. There is a
continual calling for the drawers, there is a clinking of
hanaps and a murmur of voices.</p>

<p>The <i>strepitus</i>, however, of the High Street is not like that
of Bankside. There is no tinkling of guitars: no singing
before noon or after noon: no laughing: the country folk do
not laugh: they do not understand the wit of the poets and
the players. High Street has nothing to do with Bankside:
the merchants and the squires know nothing about the Show
Folk.</p>

<p>There was one exception. Among the Show Folk was a
certain Edward Alleyn, who was a man of business as well
as a conductor of entertainments. He was on the vestry of
St. Saviour's: he was also churchwarden, his name appears in
the parish accounts of the period. He was a popular churchwarden:
probably he had about him so much of the showman
that he was genial, and mannerly, and courteous&mdash;these are the
elementary virtues of the profession. For we find that when
he proposes to retire his fellow members of the vestry refuse
to let him go.</p>

<p>It is melancholy to walk down the High Street and to
reflect that all these inns, most of them so picturesque, were
standing thirty or forty years ago, and that some of them
were standing ten years ago. One of them is figured in the
'Pickwick Papers.' The courtyard is too vast: the figures are
too small: the galleries are too large: but the effect produced
is admirable. Now not only are the old Inns gone, but there
is nothing to take their place: a modern public-house is
not an Inn. The need of an Inn at Southwark is gone:
there are no more caravans of produce brought up to the
Borough: the High Street has become the shop and the provider
of everything for the populations of the parishes of St.
Saviour, St. Olave, St. Thomas, and St. George.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span></p>

<br />
THE DEBTORS' PRISON</h2>


<p>There was another kind of Sanctuary in Southwark, a place
of Refuge not invited, and of security against one's will&mdash;The
Debtors' Prison. In fact, there were three Debtors' Prisons&mdash;the
King's Bench, the Marshalsea, and the Borough Compter.
The consideration of these melancholy places&mdash;all the more
melancholy because they were full of noisy revelry&mdash;fills
one with amazement to think that a system so ridiculous
should be continued so long, and should be abandoned with
so much regret, reluctance, and with forebodings so gloomy.
There would be no more credit, no more confidence, if the
debtor could not be imprisoned. Trade would be destroyed.
The Debtors' Prison was a part of trade. It is fifty years
and more since the power of imprisoning a debtor for life
was taken from the creditor: yet there is as much credit as
ever, and as much confidence. To a trading community
such as ours it seems, naturally, that the injury inflicted upon
a merchant by failing to pay his just claims is so great that
imprisonment ought to be awarded to such an offender. The
Law gave the creditor the power of revenge full and terrible
and lifelong. The Law said to the debtor: 'Whether you are
to blame or not, you owe money which you cannot pay: you
shall be locked up in a crowded prison: you shall be deprived
of your means of getting a livelihood: you shall have no
allowance of food: you shall have no fire: you shall have no
bed: you shall be forced to herd with a noisome unwashed
crowd of wretches: and whereas a criminal may get off with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
a year or two, you shall be sentenced to life-long imprisonment.'</p>

<p>The barbarity of the system, its futility, because the
debtor was deprived of the means of making money to pay
his debts, withal, were exposed over and over again: prisoners
wrote accounts of their prisons: commissions held inquiry
into the management of the prisons: regulations were laid
down: Acts were passed to release debtors by hundreds at one
time: the system of allowing prisoners to live in 'Rules' was
tolerated: but the real evil remained untouched so long as a
creditor had the power of imprisoning a debtor. The power
was abused in the most monstrous manner: a man owed a
few shillings: he could not pay: he was put into prison: the
next day he discovered that he was in debt to an attorney
for as many pounds. If he owed as much as 10<i>l.</i>, the bill
against him for his arrest amounted to 11<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> of what we
should now call 'taxed costs.' In the year 1759 there were
20,000 prisoners for debt in Great Britain and Ireland. Think
what that means: all those were in enforced idleness. Why,
their work at 2<i>s.</i> a day means 600,000<i>l.</i> a year: all that wealth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
lost to the State: nay more, because they were mostly married
men with families: their families had to be maintained, so
that not only did the country lose 600,000<i>l.</i> a year by the
idleness of the debtors, it also lost that much again for the
maintenance of their families. Put it in another way. A
poor man knowing one trade which one cannot practise in a
prison owed, say, 15<i>s.</i> He was arrested and put into prison.
He lived there for thirty years. He lived on doles and the
proceeds of the begging box, and what his friends could give
him: he lived, say, on five shillings a week. He cost some one
therefore; the charitable people who dropped money into the
box; the community; for his maintenance in the prison, and
for thirty years of it, the sum total of 400<i>l.</i> This is rather
an expensive tax on the State: but the tradesman to whom
he owed the money considered no more than his own 15<i>s.</i> In
addition there were his wife and children to keep until the
latter were self-supporting. This charge represented perhaps
another 400<i>l.</i> But there were 20,000 debtors in prison. If
they were all in like evil case, the State was taxed on their
behalf in the sum of sixteen millions spread over thirty
years, or half a million a year, because these luckless creatures
could not pay an insignificant debt of a few shillings or a few
pounds.</p>

<p>The King's Bench was the largest of all the Debtors'
Prisons. It formerly stood on the east side of the High
Street, on the site of what is now the second street north of
St. George's Church. This prison was taken down in 1758,
and the Debtors were removed to a larger and much more
commodious place on the other side of the street south of
Lant Street&mdash;the site is now marked by a number of new
and very ugly houses and mean streets. When it was built
it looked out at the back of St. George's Fields and across
Lambeth Marsh, then an open space, and by this time
drained. But the good air without was fully balanced by the
bad air within.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span></p>

<p>The place was surrounded by a very high wall, the area
covered was extensive, and the buildings were more commodious
than had ever before been attempted in a prison.
But they were not large enough. In the year 1776 the
prisoners had to lie two in a bed, and even for those who
could pay there were not beds enough, and many slept on
the floor of the chapel. There were 395 prisoners: in addition
to the prisoners many of them had wives and children
with them. There were 279 wives and 725 children: a total
of 1,399 sleeping every night in the prison. There was a
good water supply, but there was no infirmary, no resident
surgeon, and no bath. Imagine a place containing 1,399
persons, and no bath and no infirmary!</p>

<span class="caption">KING&#39;S BENCH PRISON</span>
</div>

<p>Among these prisoners, about a hundred years ago, was a
certain Colonel Hanger, who has left his memoirs behind
him for the edification of posterity. According to him, the
prison 'rivalled the purlieus of Wapping, St. Giles, and St.
James's in vice, debauchery, and drunkenness.' The general
immorality was so great that it was only possible, he says,
to escape contagion by living separate or by consorting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
only with the few gentlemen of honour who might be
found there: 'otherwise a man will quickly sink into dissipation:
he will lose every sense of honour and dignity:
every moral principle and virtuous disposition.' Among
the prisoners in Hanger's time, there were seldom fifty
who had any regular means of sustenance. They were
always underfed. At that time a detaining creditor had to
find sixpence a day for the prisoner's support. But in 1798
a pound of bread cost 4½<i>d.</i>, a pint of porter 2<i>d.</i>: therefore a
man who had to live on 6<i>d.</i> a day could not get more than a
pound of bread and a half pint of porter. And then the 6<i>d.</i>
a day was constantly withheld on some pretence or another,
and the poor prisoner had not the wherewithal to engage an
attorney to secure his rights. And as for attorneys their
name stank in the prison: more than half of the prisoners,
Hanger avers, were kept there solely because they could
not pay the attorneys' costs.</p>

<p>Those prisoners who knew any trade which could be
carried on in the King's Bench were fortunate. The cobbler,
the tailor, the barber, the fiddler, the carpenter, could get employment
and were able to maintain themselves: some of
them kept shops, and the principal building in the place,
about 360 feet long, had its ground floor, looking out upon
an open court, occupied by shops where everything could
be bought except spirits, which were forbidden. They were
brought in, however, secretly by the visitors. The open court
was the common Recreation Ground: there was the Parade, a
Walk along the front of the building: three pumps where were
benches: these were three separate centres of conversation:
there were racket and fives courts: a ground for the play
called 'bumble puppy.' And in fine weather there were
tables set out here and there, with chairs and benches, where
the collegians drank beer and smoked tobacco.</p>

<span class="caption">The King&#39;s Bench Prison</span>
</div>

<p>Anybody might enter the Prison to visit an inmate or to
look round: every day the place was thronged with visitors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
chiefly to see the new comers: the time came when the newcomer
was an old resident, who had worn out the kindness of
his friends or had outlived them, and now lingered on, poor
and friendless, in this living grave. All day long the children
played in the court, shouting and running: they saw things
that they ought not to have seen: they heard things which
they ought not to have heard: they learned habits which
they ought not to have learned. Can one conceive a worse
school for a boy than the King's Bench Prison? Look at the
Court on a fine and sunny afternoon. The whole College is
out and in the open: some stroll up and down: in the Prison
nobody ever walks: they all stroll: even, it may be said without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
unkindness, they slouch. The men wear coats which are
mostly in holes at the elbows, with other garments that
equally show signs of decay: they wear slippers because it
is absurd to wear boots in a prison: the slippers are down at
heel&mdash;never mind: no one cares here whether one is shabby
or not: it is better to go ragged than to go hungry. If the
men are ragged the women are slatternly: they have lost
even the feminine desire to please: they please nobody,
and certainly not their husbands: they are shrewish as to
tongue and vicious as to temper. Look at their faces: there
is this face and that face, but there is not a single happy face
among them all. The average face is resentful, painted with
strong drink, stamped with the seal of vice and self-indulgence.
A vile place, which has imprinted its own vileness
on the face of everyone who lives within its walls.</p>

<p>A worse place than the King's Bench was a wretched
little Prison called the Borough Compter. It was used both
for debtors and for criminals. Now you shall hear what
marvellous thing in the way of cruelty can be brought about
when the execution of the law is entrusted to such men as
prison warders and turnkeys.</p>

<p>The place consisted of a women's ward, a debtors' ward, a
felons' ward, and a yard for exercise. The yard was nineteen
feet square: this was the only exercising ground for all the
prisoners. When Buxton visited the place in the year 1817,
there were then thirty-eight debtors, thirty women, and twenty
children&mdash;all had to exercise themselves in this little yard:
he does not say how many felons there were. The debtors'
ward consisted of two rooms, each of which was twenty feet
long and about nine feet broad. Each room was furnished
with eight straw beds, sixteen rugs, and a piece of timber for
a pillow. Twenty prisoners slept side by side on these beds!
That gives a breadth of twelve inches for each. No one
therefore could move in bed. The place was shut up: in the
morning the heat and stench were so awful that when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
door was opened all rushed together, undressed as they were,
into the yard for fresh air. Now and then a man would be
brought in with an infectious disease or covered with vermin:
they had to endure his company as best they could. There
was no infirmary: no surgeon: no conveniences whatever in
case of sickness. And the place was so crowded that those
who might have carried on their trade could not for want of
space. As for the women's ward, I forbear to speak. Think,
however, of the noisome, horrible, stinking place, narrow and
confined, with its felons' ward of innocent and guilty, tried
and untried: the past masters in villainy with the innocent
country boy: the honest working man with his wife and
children slowly starving and slowly poisoned by the brutal law
which permitted a creditor to send him there for life for a paltry
debt of a few shillings. Think of the simple-minded country girl
thrust into the women's ward, where wickedness was authorised,
where nothing was disguised! I sometimes ask whether in the
year 1998 the historian of manners will call attention to the
lamentable brutality of this the end of the nineteenth century.
There are some points as to which I am doubtful. But I cannot
believe that there will be anything alleged against us
compared with the sleek complacency with which the City
Fathers and the Legislators regarded the condition of the
Debtors' Prisons.</p>

<p>I have not forgotten the Marshalsea. The position of
the Marshalsea Prison was changed from its first site south of
King Street in the year 1810, when it was removed to the
site which it occupied down to the end, overlooking St.
George's Churchyard. The choice of that site is a good
illustration of English conservatism. Why was the Marshalsea
brought there? Because there had been a prison on the
spot before. From time immemorial the Surrey Prison had
stood there. They called the place the White Lyon. It still
stood when the Marshalsea was brought there: it was still
standing when the Marshalsea was pulled down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span></p>

<p>I think it was in the year 1877 or 1878 or thereabouts that I
walked over to see the Marshalsea before it was pulled down.
I found a long narrow terrace of mean houses&mdash;they are still
standing: there was a narrow courtyard in front for exercise
and air: a high wall separated the prison from the Churchyard:
the rooms in the terrace were filled with deep cupboards on
either side of the fireplace: these cupboards contained the
coals, the cooking utensils, the stores, and the clothes of the
occupants. My guide, a working man employed on the
demolition of another part of the Prison, pointed to certain
marks on the floor as, he said, the place where they fastened
the staples when they tied down the poor prisoners. Such
was his historic information: he also pointed out Mr. Dorrit's
room&mdash;so real was the novelist's creation. At the east end
of the terrace there were certain rooms which I believe to
have been the tap-room and the coffee-room. Then we
came to the White Lyon, which at the time I did not know to
have been the White Lyon. It was a very ancient building.
It consisted of two rooms, one above the other: the staircase
and the floors were of most solid work: the windows were
barred: bars crossed the chimney a few feet up: large square
nails were driven into the oaken pillars and into the doors.
The lower room had evidently been kitchen, day room,
sleeping room and all. Outside was a tiny yard for exercise:
this was the old Surrey Prison. I have seen another
prison exactly like it, and, if my memory does not play
tricks, it was at the little country town of Ilminster. This
was a Clink, and on this pattern, I believe, all the old Prisons
were constructed. Beyond the Clink was the chapel, a
modern structure. So far as I know, Mr. Dickens <i>père</i>, and
Mr. Dorrit, were the only persons of eminence confined in
this modern Marshalsea. In the older Marshalsea all kinds of
distinguished people were kept captive, notably Bishop Bonner,
who died there. They say that it was necessary to bury him at
midnight for fear of the people, who would have rent his dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
body in pieces if they could. Perhaps. But it was not at any
time usual for a mob of Englishmen to pull a dead body, even
of a martyr-making Marian Bishop, to pieces. Later on, in
the last century, it was the rule to bury at night. The darkness,
the flicker of the torches, increased the solemnity of the
ceremony. So that after all Bishop Bonner may have been
buried at night in the usual fashion. He lies buried somewhere
in St. George's Churchyard. It is now a pretty garden,
whose benches in fine weather are filled with people resting and
sunning themselves: in spring the garden is full of pleasant
greenery: the dead parishioners to whom headstones have been
consecrated, if they ever visit the spot, may amuse themselves
by picking out their own tombstones among the illegible ones
which line the wall. But I hardly think, wherever they may
now be quartered, they would care to revisit this place. The
owners of the headstones were in their day accounted as the
more fortunate sons of men: they were vestrymen and guardians
and churchwardens: they owned shops: they kept the inns and
ran the stage coaches and the waggons and the caravans: their
tills were heavy with guineas: their faces were smug and
smiling: their chins were double: they talked benevolent commonplace:
they exchanged the most beautiful sentiments:
and they crammed their debtors into these prisons.</p>

<p>There are other tenants of this small area: they belonged
to the great army&mdash;how great! how vast! how rapidly increasing!&mdash;of
the 'Not-quite-so-fortunate.' They were brought
here from the King's Bench and the Marshalsea: they came
from the Master's side and from the Common side. They
came here from the mean streets and lanes of the Borough:
they were the porters and the fishermen and the rogues and
the grooms and the 'service' generally. This churchyard
represents all that can be imagined of human patience, human
work, human suffering, human degradation. Everything is here
beneath our feet, and we sit among these memories unmoved
and enjoy the sunshine and forget the sorrows of the past.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span></p>

<br />
THE PLEASURE GARDENS</h2>


<p>It is somewhat remarkable that two books should have
appeared almost at the same time on the Pleasure Gardens of
London&mdash;that of Messrs. Warwick and Edgar Wroth, and that
of Mr. H. A. Rogers. I refer the reader who desires exact
and special knowledge on the subject to these two books.
For my own part I have only to speak of two or three of
these gardens, and shall confine myself to certain sources of
information neither so exact nor so detailed as those from
which Messrs. Warwick and Wroth have drawn the material
for their excellent work.</p>

<p>The Pleasure Gardens grew out of the old Bear Baiting
Gardens. The London citizen loved sport first and above all
things: next, he loved the country: to sit under the shade of
trees in the summer: to walk upon the soft sward; to smell the
flowers: to rest his eyes upon country scenes. He has always
yearned for the country while he remained in town. With
these things he desired, as a concomitant of the entertainment,
good eating, good drinking, the merry sound of music not softly
but loudly played: the voices of those who sang: and a platform
or floor for dancing. All these things he could get in
Paris Gardens so long as that place existed, together with its
bears and dogs. When the bears disappeared, what followed?
The Gardens continued without the bears. There were also
the Mulberry Gardens on the site of Buckingham House, and
the Spring Gardens at Charing Cross. In the month of July
1661 Evelyn visited the new garden of Foxhall, afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></span>
Vauxhall, and in June 1665, the year of the Plague, Pepys
spent the evening at the same place, for the first time, and
with great delight.</p>

</div>

<p>The Pleasure Garden apart from the sport of Bear and
Bull Baiting was then beginning. Before long it became a
necessity of life&mdash;at least, of the gregarious and social life
of which the eighteenth century was so fond. Many things
are said about that century, now so nearly removed from us
by the space of another century, but we cannot say that it
was not social, and that it was not gregarious. It had its
coffee houses: its clubs: its taverns: its coteries: its societies:
it loved the theatre: the opera: the concert: the oratorio: the
masquerade: the Assembly: the card-room: but most of all
the eighteenth century loved its Pleasure Gardens. It took
every opportunity of getting away from the quiet house to
crowds and noise and the scene of merriment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 426px;"><a name="VAUXHALL_JUBILEE_ADMISSION_TICKET" id="VAUXHALL_JUBILEE_ADMISSION_TICKET"></a>

<span class="caption">VAUXHALL JUBILEE ADMISSION TICKET</span>
</div>

<p>Many things were required to make a Pleasure Garden.
There must be, first, abundance of trees&mdash;at first cherry trees,
but these afterwards disappeared: if possible, there should be
avenues of trees: aisles and dark walks of trees. There must
be, next, an ornamental water with a fountain and a bridge:
there must be a row of rustic bowers or retreats in which tea
and supper could be served: there must be a platform for
open-air dancing and promenading: there must be card-rooms:
there must be a long room for dancing and for promenading,
with a gallery for the orchestra and the singers. Add to these
things a crowd every night including all classes and conditions
of men and women. The eighteenth century was by no
means a leveller of distinctions, but all classes met together
without levelling. Distinctions were preserved: each party
kept to itself: the nobleman wore his star and sash: he did not
pretend to be on a level with the people around him: they
liked him to keep up the dignity of aristocratic separation: he
brought Ladies to the Gardens, sometimes in domino, sometimes
not. They were not expected to speak to the ladies outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
their set: they danced together in the minuets: after the
minuets they withdrew. The main point about the company
of the Gardens was that each party was separate and kept
separate. In the Park, either in the morning or the afternoon,
it was not difficult to make acquaintances. The reason was
that in the Park were only to be found in the morning or the
afternoon those people who were not engaged in earning their
livelihood. Accordingly, all professional men&mdash;lawyers, physicians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">{286}</a></span>
attorneys, surgeons, artists, architects, literary people:
all those engaged in trade, from the greatest merchant to the
smallest shopkeeper, were excluded: they were occupied elsewhere.
Therefore, the servants and footmen not being
allowed in the Park, but compelled to wait outside, the people
of position had the place to themselves, and access was easy.
In the Gardens it was different: all could enter who paid the
shilling for an entrance fee. Among them were the gentlemen
in the red coat who bore His Majesty's Commission: the
young fellows about town, a noisy disreputable band with
noisy and disreputable companions: the plain citizen with his
wife and daughter, the young fellow who was courting her:
the young tradesman taking a holiday for once: the highwayman:
the common pickpocket, and whole troops of the
customary courtesan. All were here enjoying together&mdash;but
separated into tiny groups of two or three&mdash;the strings of
coloured lamps, the blare of the orchestra, the songs, the
dances, and the supper. As for the last, it seems to have
been always a cold collation: it generally consisted of chicken
and a thin slice of ham, with a bowl of punch and a bottle of
Port. There was no affectation of fine or polite behaviour;
everybody behaved exactly as he pleased: the citizen was
not <i>gêné</i> by the presence of the great lady: he prattled his
vulgar commonplaces without being abashed: nor did the
great lady put on 'side,' or behave among her own company
with any affectation of dignity or reserve in the presence of
the mercer of Ludgate Hill in the next box. Perhaps the
recognition of rank made them all behave more naturally.
After all, the mercer had his own rank. He could look
forward to becoming Alderman, Sheriff, and Lord Mayor: he
understood very well that he was already a good way up the
ladder: the social precedence which belongs to the possession
of money and the employment of many servants had already
placed him in front of a vast crowd of inferiors: he was perfectly
satisfied with his own position, although he could certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
never become a noble earl or wear a star upon his
breast, or hope to consort on equal terms with the jewelled
lady in silks which he knew (professionally) to be beyond all
price, with her rouged face and high-dressed head, who laughed
so loud and talked so fast with the noble lords her companions,
one of whom was blind drunk and the other was a
little mincing beau who walked on his toes with bent knees and
carried his hat under his arm, and spoke under his breath as
if every word was to be listened to. Do you think the honest
mercer was indignant at the manners of the great? Not he: he
called for another bowl of punch and tied his handkerchief over
his wig to keep off the damp. In the box on the other side
of the citizen from Ludgate Hill was a party also taking
supper and punch, with plenty of the latter. They were
under the lead of an extremely fine gentleman: his white
coat was covered with gold lace: his hat was laced in the
same way: his waistcoat was of flowered silk: his ruffles were
of white lace&mdash;lace of Valenciennes. The ladies with him
were dressed with a corresponding splendour. Everybody
knew that the gentleman was a highwayman: his face was
perfectly well known: he had been going on so long that his
time must soon be up. In a few months at most he would
take that fatal journey in the cart to Tyburn, there to meet
the end common to his kind. A good many people in the
Gardens knew, besides, that the ladies with him&mdash;ladies of St.
Giles in the Fields&mdash;were dressed from the stores of a receiving
house for stolen goods. Perhaps the consciousness of this cheap
and easy way of getting one's clothes made the ladies so
buoyantly and extravagantly happy, with their sprightly
sallies and their high-bred courtesy of adjectives. But the
mercer troubled himself not at all about them.</p>

<p>The toleration of the mercer ought to endear his memory
to us. For in all public assemblies there are things which
must be tolerated. Less wise, we shut up the Assembly.
We cannot keep out the Lady of the Camellias from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
Pleasure Garden. Therefore we shut up the place. In the
eighteenth century this lady was told that everybody must
behave with a certain amount of restraint: we have improved
upon that manner: we cut off our nose to spite our face: we
shut up the lovely Garden because we cannot keep her out.</p>

<p>For the same reason we have practically forbidden the
youth of the lower middle class to practise the laudable,
innocent, and delightful diversion of dancing. Not a single
place, except certain so-called clubs, where the young people
can now go to dance. Why? Because the magistrates in
their wisdom have concluded that vice free and unchecked
out of doors is better for the people than vice fettered and
restrained by the necessity of behaving decently, and compelled
to hide itself under the semblance of virtue. The
Pleasure Gardens were shut up one after the other for that
reason. When will they return? And in what form?</p>

<p>The Gardens of South London were not so celebrated as
those of the North. Against Ranelagh, Cremorne, Marylebone,
Bagnigge Wells, the White Conduit House&mdash;the South can
only point to Vauxhall as a national institution. They were,
however, of considerable note in their time, and were greatly
frequented. They lay in a half circle, like pearls on a chain,
all round South London. There were the Lambeth Wells,
the Marble Hall, and the Cumberland Gardens at Vauxhall,
besides Vauxhall itself; the Black Prince, Newington Butts;
the Temple of Flora, the Temple of Apollo, the Flora Tea
Gardens, the Restoration Spring Gardens, the Dog and Duck,
the Folly on the Thames; Cuper's Gardens; Finch's Grotto,
the Bermondsey Spa, and St. Helena Gardens, Rotherhithe.
No doubt there were others, but these were the principal
Gardens.</p>

<p>Cuper's Gardens lay exactly opposite to Somerset House.
When Waterloo Bridge and Waterloo Bridge Road were
constructed the latter passed right through the former site of
the Gardens. St. John's Church marks the southern limit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">{289}</a></span>
the Gardens. They were opened about the year 1678 by one
Cuper, gardener to the Earl of Arundel. He begged such of
the statues belonging to his master as were mutilated, and
decorated the new gardens with them. Aubrey mentions
them as belonging to Jesus College, Oxford; he calls them
Cupid's gardens, and speaks of the arbours and walks of the
place. There was a tavern connected with the gardens by
the riverside, and fireworks were exhibited. These gardens
continued until 1753, when they were suppressed as a
nuisance. Cunningham quotes the prologue to Mrs. Centlivre's
'Busy Body.'</p>

<p>In the 'Sunday Ramble' (1794) the Dog and Duck is
one of the last places visited in the course of that very
remarkable Sunday 'out,' which began at four o'clock in the
morning and ended at one o'clock next morning, such was
the zeal of the ramblers. The place was a tavern in St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
George's Fields. On its site now stands Bethlehem Hospital.
It was first built for the accommodation of those who
came to this spot in order to drink the waters of a spring
supposed to possess wonderful properties, especially in the
case of cutaneous disorders and scrofula. The spring, like
so many other medicinal springs, has long since been forgotten.
Where is Beulah Spa? Who remembereth
Hampstead Spa? Yet in its day the spring in St. George's
Wells had no small reputation. It was especially in vogue
between 1744 and 1770. Dr. Johnson advised Mrs. Thrale to
try it. When the Spa declined, the tavern looked out for
other attractions; it found them by day in certain ponds on
the Fields close to the tavern: these ponds especially on Sunday
were used for the magnificent sport of hunting the duck
by dogs. All the ponds around London, especially those
lying on the east side of Tottenham Court Road, were used
for this sport. The gallant sportsmen, their hunt over,
naturally felt thirsty: they were easily persuaded to stay for
the evening when on week days there was music, with
dancing, singing, supper, and more drink, and on Sundays
the organ, with a choice company of the most well-bred gentlemen
and ladies of similar breeding and taste.</p>

<p>Like Ranelagh and Bagnigge Wells, and indeed all the
Pleasure Gardens, the Dog and Duck was a favourite place
for breakfasts. The fashion of the public breakfast, now so
completely forgotten, was brought to London from Bath,
Tunbridge Wells, and Epsom. Tea and coffee were served
at breakfast. After breakfast the people stayed on at the
gardens, very often all day and half the night at the Dog and
Duck. There was a bowling green for fine weather, there
was also a swimming bath&mdash;I believe, the only one south of
the Thames. About three or four in the afternoon there was
dinner, with a bottle or several bottles of wine. One of the
ponds not then employed for duck-hunting was in the garden,
and served as an ornamental water, with alcoves or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">{291}</a></span>
bowers round it; a band played at intervals during the day.
In the long room there was an organ, with an excellent
organist. In the evening, there was generally a concert; the
Dog and Duck maintained its own poet and its own composer.
All this sounds very innocent and Arcadian, but in
truth the place was acquiring a most evil reputation. In
1787 it was closed on Sunday, and in 1799 it was suppressed.
In the 'Sunday Ramble' (1794) the Dog and Duck is open,
but the Ramble may have taken place before 1787. Let us
see what is going on. Remember that it is Sunday evening.
But there is not the least trace of any respect for the day,
and the place&mdash;to speak the truth&mdash;is full of the vilest
company in the world, whose histories are described in the
greedy fulness and with the hypocritical indignation against
the wickedness of the people which were common among
such writers a hundred years ago. I suppose they would
not venture to set down what they did, but for the pretence
of indignation. Thus, there is a certain City merchant, once
a Quaker and formerly a bankrupt, but now rich and
flourishing again. His companion is an ex-orange-girl,
his mistress. Observe that the writer is certainly airing
some City scandal of the day, and that his readers know
perfectly well who was meant. There is a certain Nan
Sheldon, who seems to have been a lady of some conversational
powers with a considerable fund of information about
the shady side of town life. There is also present a young
lady described as the mistress of the 'Rev. Dr. D&mdash;&mdash;s, of St.
G.' Here, no doubt, we have a piece of contemporary humour
which enables us to have a slap at the Church. There is
other company of the like kind, but this specimen must
suffice. As to the men, they are chiefly 'prentices and shopmen.
At the Dog and Duck the license to sell drink had
been withdrawn. The manager, however, met the difficulty
by engaging a free vintner, <i>i.e.</i> a member of the Vintners'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
Company, for whom no license was required. He therefore
came to sell the drink to the visitors. It is a curious illustration
of City privileges. Leaving the Dog and Duck, the
Ramblers visited the Temple of Flora, dropped a tear over
the Apollo Gardens, deserted and falling into ruins, and
visited the Flora Tea Garden. The company here was more
respectable, in consequence of some separation among the
ladies; it was not, however, very orderly, and political argument
ran high.</p>

<p>From this Tea Garden they drove to the Bermondsey Spa
Gardens. Let me extract this account of this place, which
was once so popular:</p>

<p>'We found the entrance presents a vista between trees,
hung with lamps, blue, red, green, and white; nor is the walk
in which they are hung inferior (length excepted) to the grand
walk in Vauxhall Gardens. Nearly at the upper end of the
walk is a large room, hung round with paintings, many of
them in an elegant and the rest in a singular taste. At the
upper end of the room is a painting of a butcher's shop, so
finely executed by the landlord that a stranger to the place
would cheapen a fillet of veal or a buttock of beef, a shoulder
of mutton or a leg of pork, without hesitation, if there were
not other pictures in the room to take off his attention. But
these paintings are not seen on a Sunday.</p>

<p>'The accommodations at this place on a Sunday are very
good, and the charges reasonable, and the captain, who is
very intimate with Mr. Keyse, declares that there is no place
in the vicinity of London can afford a more agreeable evening's
entertainment.</p>

<p>'This elegant place of entertainment is situate in the
lower road, between the Borough of Southwark and Deptford.
The proprietor calls it <i>one</i>, but it is nearer two miles from
London Bridge, and the same distance from that of Black-Friars.
The proprietor is Mr. Thomas Keyse, who has been
at great expense, and exerted himself in a very extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">{293}</a></span>
manner, for the entertainment of the public; and his labours
have been amply repaid.</p>

<p>'It is easy to paint the elegance of this place, situated in
a spot where elegance, among people who talk of <i>taste</i>, would
be little expected. But Mr. Keyse's good humour, his unaffected
easiness of behaviour, and his <i>genuine</i> taste for the
polite arts, have secured him universal approbation.</p>

<p>'The gardens, with an adjacent field, consist of not less
than four acres.</p>

<p>'On the north-east side of the gardens is a very fine lawn,
consisting of about three acres, and in a field, parted from
this lawn by a sunk fence, is a building with turrets, resembling
a fortress, or castle. The turrets are in the ancient style
of building. At each side of this fortress, at unequal distances,
are two buildings, from which, on public nights, bomb shells,
&amp;c., are thrown at the fortress; the fire is returned, and the
whole exhibits a very picturesque, and therefore a horrid,
prospect of a siege.</p>

<p>'After walking a round or two in the gardens we retired
into the parlour, where we were very agreeably entertained
by the proprietor, who, contrary to his own rule, favoured us
with a sight of his curious museum, for, it being Sunday, he
never shows to any one these articles; but, the captain never
having seen them, I wished him to be gratified with such an
agreeable sight.</p>

<p>'Mr. Keyse presented us with a little pamphlet, written
by the late celebrated John Oakman, of lyric memory, descriptive
of his situation, which a few years ago was but a
waste piece of ground. "Here is now," said he, "an agreeable
place, where before was but a mere wilderness piece of ground,
and, in my opinion, it was a better plan to lay it out in this
manner than any other wise, as the remoteness of any place
of public entertainment from this secured to me in my retreat
a comfortable piece of livelihood."</p>

<p>'We perfectly coincided in opinion with our worthy host,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
and, after paying for our liquor, got into our carriage, but not
before we had tasted a comfortable glass of cherry brandy, for
which Mr. Keyse is remarkable for preparing.'</p>

<p>I am not here writing a history of South London. Were
this a history, Vauxhall Gardens would demand its own place,
and a very large place. A garden which continued to be a
favourite resort from the year 1660 or thereabouts until the
year 1859, when it was finally abandoned, which occupies so
large a part in the literature of that long period, must have
its history told in length when a history is written of the
place where it stood. In this place I desire to do no
more than to take off my hat to this Queen of Gardens, and
to recognise her importance. The history of Vauxhall is an
old story; it has been told at greater or less length, over and
over again. We seem to know all the anecdotes which have
been copied from one writer by another, and all the literature
and all the poetry about Vauxhall. The poetry is, indeed,
very poor stuff. The best are the lines of Canning:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There oft returning from the green retreats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where fair Vauxhallia decks her sylvan seats;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where each spruce nymph, from City counters free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sips the frothed syllabub or fragrant tea:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While with sliced ham, scraped beef, and burnt champagne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her 'prentice lover soothes his amorous pain.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What a chain of anecdotes it is! We begin in 1661 with
Evelyn, who treats the place with his accustomed brevity and
coldness; we go on to Pepys, who records how the visitors
picked cherries, and how the nightingales sang, and lets us
understand how much he enjoyed his visits there, and how
delightful he found the place, and how much after his own
heart; we proceed to Congreve and Tom Brown, to Addison,
to Fielding, to Horace Walpole. We all know the Dark
Walk, and how the ladies were taken there, not unwillingly,
to be frightened: we know the stage where they danced: we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></span>
know the orchestra; we know the Chinese Room: we know
Rowlandson's picture of the evening at Vauxhall with the
Prince of Wales, putting on princely arrogance in the
middle, and the Duchess of Devonshire and her friends
apparently making fun of him; and in the side box, having
supper, Goldsmith and Boswell, and Mrs. Traill, and Dr.
Johnson; with Miss Linley singing; and we all know about
the forty thousand coloured lamps festooned about the trees.</p>

<p>London was not London, life was not worth having,
without Vauxhall. Like Mrs. Cornelys's masquerades and
assemblies, Vauxhall was the great leveller of the eighteenth
century. A man might be an earl or a prince: he would get
no more enjoyment out of Vauxhall than a 'prentice who
had a little money to spare. And the milliner going to
Vauxhall with that 'prentice was quite as happy as any lady
in the land could be.</p>

<p>When one thinks of Vauxhall and all it meant, one is
carried away by admiration. To the City Miss who might
belong to the City Assembly, but most likely did not, there
was no such spectacle in the world as those avenues of trees
with their thousands of coloured lamps; there was nothing
that so much made her heart leap up as the sight of the
dancing in the open air to the music of the orchestra in the
high stand; there was nothing so delightful as to sit in an
arbour dimly lighted, and to make a supper off cold chicken
with a glass of punch afterwards&mdash;girls drank punch then&mdash;to
look out upon the company, resplendent, men and women
alike, in their dress, and ceremonious in their manners; to be
told how the one was the young Lord Mellamour and the
angel with him was a danseuse of Covent Garden: and that
other gentleman behind them was the Rev. Dr. Scattertext
of St. Bride's; and that the dashing young fellow in peach-coloured
velvet was no other than Sixteen String Jack the
highwayman. Vauxhall, in fact, for two hundred years, was
nothing less than a national institution. All classes who could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>
command a decent coat went to Vauxhall. The Prince of
Wales went there&mdash;once or twice he was recognised and
mobbed; all the great ladies went there; all the lesser ladies;
all the ladies of the half world; all the citizens, from the
Alderman to the 'prentice; all the adventurers; all the
gallant highwaymen. There was a charming toleration about
the visitors to Vauxhall. They were not in the least disturbed
by the presence of the highwaymen, of the adventurers,
or of the ladies corresponding to those gentlemen&mdash;not
in the least; they walked together in the lanes and aisles
of the place; they ate supper in the next arbour; they saw
the young rakes carrying on openly and without the least
disguise. The sober citizen saw it; his sober wife saw it; her
daughter saw it. There were no complaints, save occasionally
from the Surrey magistrates. The place and the behaviour
of the people are typical of the eighteenth century, in which
the maintenance of order was thrown upon the public, and
there were no police. If things got very bad in a pleasure
garden, the magistrates refused a license; if the visitors were
robbed by highwaymen on their way to and from the place,
guards were appointed by the managers. Vauxhall, however,
was safer than most places, because most of the people came
by boat. In common with all places of amusement in the
eighteenth century, Vauxhall was late. The people seem to
have been allowed to stay there nearly all night.</p>

<p>There is a passage quoted in Chambers's 'Book of Days,'
which I should like to transfer with acknowledgments to this
page. It is from the 'Connoisseur' of 1755, and discusses a
Vauxhall slice of ham.</p>

<p>'When it was brought, our honest friend twirled the dish
about three or four times, and surveyed it with a settled
countenance. Then taking up a slice of the ham on the
point of his fork, and dangling it to and fro, he asked the
waiter how much there was of it. "A shilling's worth, sir,"
said the fellow. "Prithee," said the cit, "how much dost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span>
think it weighs?" "An ounce, sir." "Ah! a shilling an
ounce, that is sixteen shillings per pound; a reasonable
profit, truly! Let me see. Suppose, now, the whole ham
weighs thirty pounds: at a shilling per ounce, that is sixteen
shillings per pound. Why, your master makes exactly
twenty-four pounds off of every ham; and if he buys them
at the best hand, and salts and cures them himself, they don't
stand him in ten shillings a-piece!"'</p>

<p>In 1841 there seemed every prospect that the gardens
would be closed; they were not closed, however, but were
reopened and continued open until the year 1859, where they
were finally closed and the farewell night was celebrated.</p>

<p>The scare, however, in 1841 produced in June a brief
history of Vauxhall Gardens in one of the morning papers&mdash;I
do not know which&mdash;I have it as a cutting only. It is as
follows:</p>

<p>'Vauxhall Gardens are announced for public sale under
Gye and Hughes's bankruptcy, and their past celebrity deserves
a notice, if only as a memento of the pleasure the
old and young have experienced in their delightful retreats,
while their hundredfold associations, such as the journey of Sir
Roger de Coverley to the gardens, old Jonathan Tyers, and
the paintings in the pavilions by Hayman and Hogarth, create
an interest seldom to be met with. The gardens derive their
name from the manor of Vauxhall, or Faukeshall, but the
tradition that the property belonged to Guy Fawkes is
erroneous. The premises were in 1615 the property of Jane
Vaux, and the mansion was then called Stockdens. The
gardens appear to have been originally planted with trees and
laid out into walks for the pleasure of a private gentleman, Sir
Samuel Moreland, who displayed in his house and gardens
many whimsical proofs of his skill in mechanics. It is said
these gardens were planted in the reign of Charles I.; nor is
it improbable, since, according to Aubrey, they were well
known in 1667, when Sir Samuel Moreland, the proprietor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
added a public room to them, "the inside of which," he says,
"is all looking-glass and fountains and very pleasant to
behold, and which is much visited by strangers." The time
when they were first opened for the entertainment of the
public is involved in some uncertainty; their celebrity is,
however, established to be upwards of a century and a half
old. In the reign of Queen Anne they appear to have been
a place of great public resort, for in the "Spectator," No. 383,
dated May 20, 1712, Addison has introduced Sir Roger de
Coverley as accompanying him in a voyage from Temple-stairs
to Vauxhall, then called Spring Gardens. He says:
"We made the best of our way to Foxhall;" and describes
the gardens as "exceedingly pleasant at this time of the
year. When I considered the fragrancy of the walks and
bowers with the choirs of birds that sung upon the trees and
the tribe of people that walked under their shades, I could
not but look on this place as a sort of Mohammedan Paradise."
Masks were then worn, at least by some visitors, for
Addison talks of "a mask tapping Sir Roger on the shoulder
and inviting him to drink a bottle of mead with her." A
glass of Burton ale and a slice of hung beef formed the supper
of the party. The place, however, resembled a tea-garden of
our days till the year 1730, when Mr. Jonathan Tyers took a
lease of the premises, and shortly afterwards opened Vauxhall
with a <i>Ridotto al Fresco</i>. The novelty of the term attracted
great numbers, and Mr. Tyers was so successful in occasional
repetitions as to be induced to open the gardens every evening
during the summer. Hogarth at this time had lodgings
at Lambeth-terrace, and, becoming intimate with Tyers, was
induced to embellish the gardens with his designs, in which he
was joined by Hayman. The house which he occupied is
still shown, and a vine pointed out which he planted. Tyers's
improvements consisted of sweeps of pavilions and saloons,
in which these paintings were placed. He also erected an
orchestra, engaged a band of music, and placed a fine statue of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">{299}</a></span>
Handel by Roubiliac in a conspicuous part of the gardens.
Mr. Cunningham dates the appearance of this statue, which
was Roubiliac's earliest work, at 1732. Mr. Tyers afterwards
purchased the whole of the estate, which is copyhold of inheritance,
and held of the Prince of Wales, as lord of Kennington
manor, in right of his Duchy of Cornwall. The
gardens were originally opened daily (Sunday excepted), and
till the year 1792 the admission was 1<i>s.</i>; it was then raised
to 2<i>s.</i>; including tea and coffee; in 1809 several improvements
were made, lamps added, &amp;c., the price was raised to
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and the gardens were only opened three nights in the
week; in 1821 the price was again raised to 4<i>s.</i> Upon the
death of Mr. Jonathan Tyers, the gardens became the property
of Mr. Bryant Barrett, who married the granddaughter
of the original proprietor. They next descended to Mr.
Barrett's sons, and from them by right of purchase to the late
proprietors. Mr. Thomas Tyers, a son of the famous Jonathan
Tyers, and author of "Biographical Sketches of Johnson,"
and "Political Conferences," who died on February 1, 1787,
contributed many poetic trifles to the gardens. The representation
of the <i>Ridotto al Fresco</i> is thus described by one of
the newspapers of June 21, 1732: "On Wednesday, at the
<i>Ridotto al Fresco</i> at Vauxhall, there was not one half of the
company as was expected, being no more than 203 persons,
amongst whom were several persons of distinction, but more
ladies than gentlemen, and the whole was managed with
great order and decency; a detachment of 100 of the Foot
Guards being posted round the gardens. A waiter belonging
to the house having got drunk put on a dress and went to
<i>fresco</i> with the rest of the company, but being discovered he
was immediately turned out of doors." The season of 1739
was for three months, and the admittance was by silver
tickets. The proprietors then announced that "1,000 tickets
would only be delivered at 25<i>s.</i> each, the silver of every
ticket to be worth 3<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>, and to admit two persons every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
evening (Sunday excepted) during the season." It appears
that these silver tickets were struck after designs by Hogarth,
and a plate of some of them shows the following:&mdash;Mr. John
Hinton, 212, 1794; on the reverse side the figure of Calliope.
Mr. Wood, 63, 1750; on the reverse side three boys playing
with a lyre, and the motto "<i>Jocosæ conveniunt Lyræ.</i>" Mr.
R. Frankling, 70; on the reverse side figure of Euterpe.
Mr. Samuel Lewes, 87; on the reverse side the figure of
Erato. Mr. Carey, 11; on the reverse side the figure of Thalia.
This plate also exhibits the gold ticket, a perpetual admission
given to Hogarth by Jonathan Tyers, in gratitude for his
advice and assistance in decorating the gardens. After his
decease it remained in the hands of Mrs. Hogarth, his widow,
who bequeathed it to her relation, Mrs. Mary Lewis, who
subsequently left it to Mr. P. F. Hart, who in his will, in 1823,
bequeathed it to Mr. John Tuck. It is hardly necessary to say
that the ticket is after Hogarth's own design. The face of it
presents the word "Hogarth," in a bold hand, beneath which
is "<i>In perpetuam beneficii memoriam.</i>" On the reverse there
are two figures, surrounded with the motto, "<i>Virtus voluptas
felices una.</i>" It also appears that Roubiliac furnished a
statue of Milton for the gardens. Among the singers
Beard and Lowe were early favourites; then came Dignum,
Mrs. Weichsel, Mrs. Billington, Signora Storace, Incledon,
Mrs. Bland, &amp;c. In later years, Misses Tunstall, Noel,
Melville, and Williams; Stephens, Love, Madame Cornega,
and Madame Vestris; Mr. Braham, Mr. Sinclair, Mr. Robinson,
and Signor de Begnis, &amp;c., with Signor Spagnoletti as
leader.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span></p>

<p>The expansion of London
during the Nineteenth
Century is in
itself a fact unparalleled
in the history of cities.
Those who call attention
to this miracle always
point to the filling up
of the huge area between
Highgate and Hampstead
and Clerkenwell
in the North, or the
extension of the town
to Hammersmith on
the West. Perhaps a
little consideration of
the South may show
a still more remarkable
growth. I have
before me a map of the
year 1834, only sixty-four
years ago, showing
South London as it was.
I see a small town
or collection of small
towns, occupying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">{302}</a></span>
district called the Borough Proper, Lambeth, Newington,
Walworth, and Bermondsey. In some parts this area is
densely populated, filled with narrow courts and lanes; in other
parts there are broad fields, open spaces, unoccupied pieces
of ground. At the back of Vauxhall Gardens, for instance
there are open fields; in Walworth there is a certain place,
then notorious for the people who lived there, called Snow's
Fields; in Bermondsey there are also open spaces, some of
them gardens, or recreation grounds, without any buildings.
Battersea is a mere stretch of open country. I myself remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>
the old Battersea Fields perfectly well; one shivers
at the recollection; they were low, flat, damp, and, I believe,
treeless; they were crossed, like Hackney Marsh, by paths
raised above the level; at no time of year could the
Battersea Fields look anything but dreary. In winter they
were inexpressibly
dismal. As
a boy I have
walked across
the fields in
order to get
to the embankment
or river
wall from which one
commanded a view of
the Thames with its
barges and lighters going up and down&mdash;pleasant when the
sun shone on the river, but a mere shadow of the ancient
glory when the pleasure barges and the State barges swept
majestically up the river with the hautboys and the trumpets
in the bows; when the swans by thousands sailed upon the
broad bosom of the waters, and in the middle of the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">{304}</a></span>
the fisherman cast his net, as Edric had done fifteen hundred
years before at St. Peter's orders, when he brought out his
famous salmon. One walked along the embankment; the
fields on one side were lower than the waters on the other.
Beyond the river were the trees of Chelsea Hospital. Close
to the river bank was an enclosure which was called the Subscription
Ground; here the subscribers came to shoot pigeons&mdash;noble
sport. If I remember aright, while the subscribing
sportsmen shot at the pigeons in the enclosure, others of low
condition who were not subscribers lurked about on the outside
to shoot down those birds which escaped from the murderers
within. Close by the Subscription Ground was a certain famous
tavern called the Red House. I do not know why it was
famous, but everybody always said it was. I believe it was
much frequented on summer evenings, and that the subscribing
sportsmen close by, whether they hit their pigeon or not,
proved excellent customers for the drinks of the Red House.
At that time there were 'famous' taverns all up and down
the river on either bank. There are still Riverside taverns,
but the invasion of the new streets and houses has driven
them, considered as 'famous' taverns, either higher up, or
lower down. As mere commonplace public houses they
probably remain still. Duels were conducted on the Battersea
Fields, and there were certain historical associations in connection
with these dreary flats. Here, for instance, the Duke
of Wellington fought his duel with Lord Winchilsea. Other
important people were also connected either with the Fields
or the Village of Battersea, but at the time I knew not anything
about them. The Battersea of my boyhood is gone
absolutely: no trace of it remains, except the Church. The
Grosvenor Railway Bridge passes over the site of the famous
Red House; the most beautiful of all our Parks covers the
Subscription Shooting Grounds, together with most of the
flat and dreary fields; and houses by the thousand, with
streets mean and monotonous, stand where formerly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">{305}</a></span>
pigeons flew wildly, hoping to escape those who waited
outside the grounds as they had escaped those who potted at
them from within.</p>

<span class="caption">HOLY TRINITY, ROTHERHITHE</span>
</div>

<p>Let us turn to another part of the map and inquire into
Rotherhithe. It is curious that at one end we get Rotherhithe,
the Place of Cattle; and at the other Lambeth or
Lambhythe, if it be the 'Place of Lambs' and not the 'Place
of Mud.' In 1834 the Commercial Docks are already there,
but without prejudice to the ancient and venerable docks of
the preceding century, Acorn Dock and Lavender Dock. A
single street runs along the Embankment, which it hides and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>
covers: at the back of this street there is a succession of
small lanes and courts running back with tiny houses&mdash;two
or four rooms to each&mdash;on either side, and ending generally
in gardens of greenery&mdash;leaves and palings. You may still
see, in 1898, if you are lucky, the bows and bowsprit of a ship
in one of the old docks, sticking across the street, causing a
momentary confusion in the mind between land and water;
there are riverside taverns which look as if at a touch they
would yield and slide into the mud below. In 1834 this
street with these little lanes was the whole of Rotherhithe.
Inland&mdash;or in-marsh&mdash;ponds and ditches and creeping streams
lay about; one of the ponds survives to this day; you will
find it in the middle of the pretty garden they call Southwark
Park, of which it forms the ornamental water. And the rest
of Rotherhithe, between the Park and Bermondsey, is one
unbroken mass of streets with no green thing and no open
space. All is filled up and built upon.</p>

<p>A little beyond Rotherhithe lies Deptford. On my map
of 1834 I see a little town, lying partly on the bank of the
Thames, partly on the bank of the Ravensbourne, which here
widens out and forms Deptford Creek. The greater part of
the area of Deptford is taken up by the Dockyard, not yet
closed. As for the town, which now contains nearly 100,000
people, about five-and-twenty little streets sufficed for all its
people; it boasted of two churches and two almshouses.
One of these Havens of Rest was so picturesque and so
beautiful that it could not be suffered to remain. Almshouses
which are perfectly beautiful are only vouchsafed to
man for a limited period, lest other buildings become intolerable.
Their time expired, they are then carried off
Heavenward.</p>

<p>Or turn your eyes further south. London in this
direction now covers&mdash;for the most part completely, in some
parts leaving spaces and fields here and there&mdash;Greenwich,
Blackheath, Brockley, Peckham, Forest Hill, Dulwich,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">{307}</a></span>
Brixton, Stockwell, Camberwell, Clapham, Balham, Wandsworth,
Vauxhall, and Penge, and many others.</p>

<p>It is difficult, now that the whole country south of
London has been covered with villas, roads, streets, and shops,
to understand how wonderful for loveliness it was until the
builder seized upon it. When the ground rose out of the
great Lambeth and Bermondsey Marsh&mdash;the cliff or incline
is marked still by the names of Battersea Rise, Clapham
Rise, and Brixton Rise&mdash;it opened out into one wild heath
after another&mdash;Clapham, Wandsworth, Putney, Wimbledon,
Barnes, Tooting, Streatham, Richmond, Thornton, and so
south as far as Banstead Downs. The country was not
flat: it rose at Wimbledon to a high plateau; it rose at
Norwood to a chain of hills; between the Heaths stretched
gardens and orchards; between the orchards were pasture
lands; on the hill sides were hanging woods; villages were
scattered about, each with its venerable church and its
peaceful churchyard; along the high roads to Dover,
Southampton, and Portsmouth bumped and rolled, all day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
and all night, the stage coaches and the waggons; the
wayside inns were crowded with those who halted to drink,
those who halted to dine, and those who halted to sleep: if
the village lay off the main road it was as quiet and as secure
as the town of Laish. All this beauty is gone; we have
destroyed it: all this beauty has gone for ever; it cannot be
replaced. And on the south there was so much more beauty
than on the north. On the latter side of London there are
the heights with Hampstead, Highgate, and Hornsey&mdash;one
row of villages; but there is little more. The country
between Hatfield or St. Albans and Hampstead is singularly
dull and uninteresting: it is not until one reaches Hertford or
Rickmansworth that the explorer comes once more into lovely
country. But the loveliness of South London lay almost at
the very doors of London: one could walk into it; the
heaths were within an easy walk, and the loveliness of
Surrey lay upon all.</p>

<p>I have mentioned already some of the heaths, those which
remain at the present moment. It will be a matter of
surprise to the reader to hear of the many waste and wild
places which have been appropriated and built over in the last
two hundred years. In the parish of Lambeth alone, an
extensive tract, it is true, there was nearly 500 acres of
commons: namely, Kennington, Norwood, Norwood
Common (in another part of Norwood), Hall Lane, Knight's
Hill Green, Half Moon Green, Rush Common, South
Stockwell Common, South Lambeth and North Stockwell
Common. With the exception of the first all these are now
gone.</p>

<p>Look at Dulwich&mdash;the peaceful and picturesque village
of Dulwich on this map of 1834. It lies among its trees, its
gardens, and its fields: the venerable college of Alleyn is the
glory of the village&mdash;nothing more beautiful than this almshouse
with its hall and its picture gallery. Yet the people
flocked out to Dulwich less for the picture gallery than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span>
shady walks, the fields, and a certain tavern&mdash;the Greyhound&mdash;which
was beloved by everybody, and believed to contain a
particular brew of beer, a particular kind of old Jamaica for
punch, and a particular vintage of port not to be found anywhere
else, even in a City company's cellars. There was, in fact, no
more favourite place of resort for the better sort of citizens of
London than Dulwich in the summer. For the poorer sort
it was too far off, and cost too much in conveyance. The
Dulwich stage ran two or three times a day: it was not too
long a drive from the city; the young men rode&mdash;in those
days the young men could all ride&mdash;even John Gilpin thought
he could ride; they hired a horse as we now get into a cab.
For those who lived in any suburb on the south, Dulwich
was an easy walk. Not far from the college and the village&mdash;Mr.
Pickwick lived there in 1834&mdash;were the Dulwich Fields,
as beautiful and interesting as those of Battersea were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
contrary: there were, I think, five of them in succession: the
little stream called the Effra rose somewhere in the neighbourhood,
and ran about, winding through the fields in a deep
channel with rustic bridges across. In older days&mdash;at the
end of the eighteenth century, for example, the Effra, a
bright and sparkling stream, ran out of the fields above what
is now called the Effra Road, and so along the south side&mdash;or
was it the north?&mdash;of Brixton Road. Rustic cottages stood
on the other side of the stream, with flowering shrubs&mdash;lilac,
laburnum, and hawthorn&mdash;on the bank, and beds of the
simpler flowers in the summer: the gardens and the cottages
were approached by little wooden bridges, each provided with
a single rail painted green. That, however, was before my
time. In the 'fifties the boys used to play in these fields,
jumping over the stream: when they left the fields and got
into the village they looked about for Mr. Pickwick and for
Sam Weller, if haply they might see either. But I do not
learn that either sage or servant ever gratified those eyes of
faith by an incarnation.</p>

<p>Here are three hills close together: Herne Hill, Denmark
Hill, and Champion Hill. On Denmark Hill Ruskin once
lived; but in the 'fifties I was not conscious of that fact or of
his greatness. It must be saddening to a great man to reflect
that the schoolboys have no respect for him. The road
up the hill was somewhat gloomy on account of the trees:
the houses, with their gardens and lawns, and carriage drives,
and smoothness and snugness, betokened in those years the
institution of evening prayers. I fear I may be misunderstood.
At that time great was the power and the authority of
seriousness. To be serious was fashionable, if one may say
so, in City circles. Respectability was nearly always serious:
it was divided into two classes: that which had morning
prayers only, and that which had evening prayers as well.
With the young, the latter institution was unpopular&mdash;no one
of the present younger generation can understand how unpopular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></span>
it was: a house which had evening prayers made a
deliberate profession of a seriousness which was something
out of the common, which the young people disliked, as a
rule; and it insisted on the sons getting home in time for
prayers. This profession of seriousness generally belonged
to a large house, beautiful gardens, rich conservatories, a large
income, and a carriage and pair. Denmark Hill used to
appear to outward view as more especially a suburb belonging
to the serious rich, who could afford a profession of more than
common earnestness.</p>

<p>Herne Hill was remarkable for consisting of three houses
only, each with its parklike grounds and gardens and its
noble trees. Champion Hill I remember as a green and
grassy slope: there were no houses at all upon it: but there
was a road, and at the bottom of the road a green called
Goose Green&mdash;you may still find this tract of grass, but I
believe it is now pinched and attenuated. On Goose Green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">{312}</a></span>
they kept ponies for hire: the boys used to ride them up the
hill and gallop them down the hill. Beyond this green there
was a much larger expanse called Peckham Rye: so far as I
can remember it was a most uninviting place formerly; not
a wild heath like Putney or Hampstead, not a waste place
covered with fern and gorse and bramble and wild trees; but
a barren, dreary expanse of uncertain grass. Boys would
perhaps have played cricket upon it in summer, but there
were then no boys at Peckham Rye. Now, all this country is
covered with houses, and Peckham is like Bloomsbury itself
for streets and terraces and squares.</p>

<p>We have not only destroyed the former beauty of South
London: we have forgotten it. Ask a resident of Penge&mdash;one
of the many thousands of Penge&mdash;what this suburban
town was like seventy years ago. Do you think he can tell
you anything of Penge Common? Has he ever heard of any
Penge Common? Well, it is exactly seventy-one years ago&mdash;viz.
in May 1827&mdash;that Mr. William Hone&mdash;the compiler of
the 'Every-Day Book,' climbed up outside the Dulwich stage,
proposing to visit the picture gallery of Dulwich College.
Hone was one of the first of those curious and inquisitive
persons who began to employ their summers in exploring the
unknown villages and strange places round London. The
picture gallery he could not see because it was closed; he
therefore walked across the country from Dulwich to a place
called Penge. At the top of a hill he found a choice of three
roads. He chose that which led through Penge Common.
The place was thickly wooded: it was, he says, 'a cathedral
of singing birds.' At the mere recollection of that choir he
bursts into verse&mdash;other people's verse. Alas! the Common
had already, even then, been ravished from its owners, the
people: it was enclosed; it was doomed; it was about to be
built upon. Mr. Hone consoled himself, however, at the
'Old Crooked Billet,' with eggs and bacon and home-brewed
ale. Again, is there anyone in Penge who now remembers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">{313}</a></span>
the hanging woods? They hung over a hillside, and were as
beautiful as the hanging woods of Cliveden. But, like the
Common, they are gone.</p>

<span class="caption">From the Tower of St. Saviour&#39;s</span>
</div>

<p>Or let us ask the resident of Norwood what he remembers
of its ancient glories; whether there were any ancient glories.
Has he heard of the famous Norwood oak? Of the Norwood
Spa? Of the gypsies of Norwood? Why, the Queen of all
the gypsies, unless there was a more powerful sovereign at
Jedburgh, held her court and camp at Norwood. Has this
resident heard of the views from the top of the hill, four
hundred feet above the level of the sea, whither the people
flocked by hundreds to see the view and to wander in the
woods?</p>

<p>All this beauty is destroyed. Of course, the destruction was
inevitable. One accepts the inevitable with a sigh; we
cannot have town and country together. The woods are gone,
the rural life is gone, encroachments have been made upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
the commons, the wayside tavern&mdash;the place was full of
wayside taverns&mdash;is gone. What remains of all this beauty
is a fragment here and there. Clapham Common, once a
heath, now a park; Wimbledon Common, Tooting Common;
these expanses are mercifully left us for breathing-places.
Some of them, like Clapham, are transformed into imitations
of a park, instead of being left as a heath. All of them are
bereft, of course, of their old accompaniments; they have
lost the wood beside the heath, the farm, the ploughed
lands, the tinkle of the sheep bell, the song of the skylark.</p>

<p>We have seen in the course of these chapters some of the
associations of South London. I confess that, for my own
part, I am not happy in considering associations connected
with rows of terraces and villas. Here, you say, was once
the house, with the park, of such and such a great man.
Really! I dare say. But it is now covered with gentility.
If I am taken to a slum&mdash;such a slum as that on the west of
St. Mary Overies, and am told that in this place was
Winchester House, I am at once interested. Why should
the memory of the past appeal to our imagination more in a
slum than in a brand new, spick and span collection of
pleasant country villas? Is it from a feeling that all things
tend to decay, and that the new suburb speaks not of decay?
Who, for instance, stepping from the south-east corner of
Tooting Common into the place which was once Streatham
Park, can think of Mrs. Thrale and Dr. Johnson among these
roads and villas? At Tooting itself, one might remember,
were it not for the houses, Daniel De Foe, who founded the
first Independent chapel there. At Wandsworth, if it were
not so much built upon, I might see Voltaire walking about.
At Putney, but for the villas, I should look for Pitt. Oh!
there are a thousand people once living, and walking, and
playing their parts in their villages, whose wraiths and
spectres would willingly haunt them still, but cannot for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">{315}</a></span>
bricks and the walls, the chimneys and the smoke, the roads
and the trams.</p>

<p>We have destroyed the beauty of South London: we
have also made its historical associations impossible.</p>

<p>The first settlers or colonisers of this region, apart from
its rural folk, came from London about the time when roads
began to be tolerable; that is to say, late in the seventeenth
century; they were the great folk, the leisured folk, the
Quality, who had suburban houses in addition to their town
houses and their country houses. They sought shelter in the
quiet retreats of Clapham, Streatham, or Norwood. These
people did not come, however, to settle, but only remained,
as a rule, for a year or two, for a few months, for a season.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">{316}</a></span>
When the roads became so far improved as to make driving
easy and pleasant, the city merchants came and built or
bought big houses, and drove in and out every day in their
carriage and pair. They did not buy estates, as a rule:
they bought a substantial house and grounds, and sat down
therein. They had large gardens behind, with greenhouses
where they grew early strawberries; they had in front a
broad lawn with a carriage drive; they liked to have on the
lawn two stately cedars, whose branches swept the grass.
They brought their friends down from Saturday to Monday.
In course of time other people came; but the first comers&mdash;these
merchants&mdash;were the aristocracy, the first families of
the suburbs. In the newer places there are still to be found
the first families; in the older suburbs they have all disappeared
from the place. Thus Clapham, I believe, knows
no longer a Macaulay, a Wilberforce, a Venn. These were
people of national distinction. Of course there were not
in other suburbs first families who rose to the giddy heights
attained by these fortunate aristocrats of the suburbs; but
there were many which had among them ex-Lord Mayors
and Aldermen; there were many persons among them of
dignity and authority. Alas! the first families are gone:
there is now no aristocracy of the suburb left. It is a
pity. There should be in every community some whose
position entitles them to respect and authority; there should
be some to take the lead naturally; there should be some
who should maintain the standards of conduct, ideas, and
principles. Especially is this the case when by far the greater
part of the people in a community are engaged in trade.</p>

<p>I cannot quite avoid the use of figures, because a comparison
between the population of these villages in 1801 with
that of these great towns in 1898 is so startling that it must be
recorded. Battersea has risen from 3,365 to 165,115; Camberwell
from 7,059 to 253,076; Lambeth from 27,985 to 295,033;
Lewisham from 4,007 to 104,521; Wandsworth from 14,283<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">{317}</a></span>
to 187,264. Or, taking the whole area of South London, that
part which is covered by the electoral districts, there is now a
population of very nearly two millions; in other words the
population, in less than a hundred years, has been multiplied
by ten. That of London itself, in the same time, the London
including the City, Clerkenwell, Whitechapel, Bloomsbury, and
Westminster, has been multiplied during the same time by
five. What has caused this enormous increase in South
London? Well, people must live somewhere; the old limits
proved insufficient. First, places which had been dotted over
with fields and gardens and vacant places, such as Southwark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">{318}</a></span>
on the west side, and Bermondsey, were completely built over
and inhabited. Then, when it became a problem how to stow
away the people within reach of their work, the 'short stage'
was supplemented by the omnibus. Next South London
stretched itself out farther; it began to include Camberwell,
Brixton, Stockwell, Clapham, and Wandsworth. These were
separate suburbs lying each among its own gardens; the inhabitants
were not clerks, but principals and employers, substantial
merchants and flourishing shopkeepers. The clerks
lived nearer London, mostly on the north of the river. Lastly
came the railway, when London made another step outward,
so as to take in the places lying south of Clapham and
Brixton. Then the builder began; he saw that a new class
of residents would be attracted by small houses and low rents.
The houses sprang up as if in a single night; streets in a
month, churches and chapels in a quarter. The population
of South London no longer consists of rich merchants, principals,
and partners. Clerks, assistants, and employés of all
kinds now crowd the morning and evening trains.</p>

<p>If you want to form some idea of the South London folk,
go stand inside Cannon Street Station and watch the trains
come in, each with its freight of those who earn their daily
bread within the City. See them pass out&mdash;by the hundred&mdash;by
the thousand&mdash;by the fifty thousand. The brain reels
at the mere contemplation of this mighty multitude which
comes in every morning and goes out every afternoon. As
they hurry past you observe on each the same expression, the
same set eagerness, with which the day's work is approached.
Employer or employé, principal or clerk, it matters nothing.
The clerk, who will get none of the thousands he is helping
to secure, comes in to town as eager for the fray as his
master; the fighting instinct is in the man; his face means
battle, daily battle, in which the weapons are superior knowledge,
earlier knowledge, keen sight, readiness, ruthlessness,
while there is as much need, for success, or courage tenacity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">{319}</a></span>
and bluff as in any battle between contending armies. The
many twinkling feet pass out of the station by the hundred
thousand, every morning, to the field of battle. The English
are a warlike people; they enjoy the field of battle; the City
is like that state of beatitude which the pious Dane desired,
in which there would be fighting every day, and all day, and
for ever.</p>

<p>In South London there are two millions of people. It is
therefore one of the great cities of the world. It stands upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">{320}</a></span>
an area about twelve miles long and five or six broad&mdash;but
its limits cannot be laid down even approximately. It is a
city without a municipality, without a centre, without a civic
history; it has no newspapers, magazines, or journals; it has
no university; it has no colleges, apart from medicine; it has
no intellectual, artistic, scientific, musical, literary centre&mdash;unless
the Crystal Palace can be considered a centre; its
residents have no local patriotism or enthusiasm&mdash;one cannot
imagine a man proud of New Cross; it has no theatres,
except of a very popular or humble kind; it has no clubs, it
has no public buildings, it has no West End. It is argued
that although it has none of these things, yet it has them all
by right of being a part of London. That is, in a sense, true.
The theatres, concerts, picture galleries of the West End are
accessible to the South. Far be it from me to deny the
culture of Sydenham and the artistic elevation of Tooting.
Yet one feels there must surely be some disadvantage in being
separated from the literary and artistic circles whose members,
it must be confessed, reside for the most part in North
London. It must surely, one thinks, be a disadvantage for a
young man who would pursue a career in art not to live
among people who habitually talk of art and think of art. It
must surely be some disadvantage to live in a place where
the people, when they are gathered together, mostly allow
the conversation to turn upon things connected with the
City.</p>

<p>How are these two millions distributed?</p>

<p>There are, in fact, four layers. First, there is the 'submerged'
element, the people of the slums of which mention
has been made. Their numbers and their proportion to the
whole I know not. Next, there are the working people, those
for whom the long lines, the endless lines, of barracks called
model lodging-houses, have been built. Here they live by
the hundred thousand&mdash;by the million: there are more than
a million working men in South London. For their use are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">{321}</a></span>
the shops of the Borough, chiefly provision shops, and the
public houses. The third layer is found on a slip of ground,
of which Newington and Kennington may be taken as representative:
it consists principally of lodging-houses for clerks.
The fourth layer is that of the suburban villa, from the little
semi-detached cottage to the stately mansion. The 'High
Street,' filled with shops, is for the villas.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="The_George_Inn" id="The_George_Inn"></a>

<span class="caption">The George Inn<br />
<br />
Little Dorrit&#39;s Window in the Marshalsea</span>
</div>

<p>Now, the whole of this immense population lives upon
the City. The bread-winners go in and out every day; the
local shops provide for the houses, and are paid out of the
money made in the City; the local doctor, the local house
agent, the local schoolmaster, the local clergyman, all receive
their share of the money made in the City; even if there be,
here and there, a literary man, his wares are bought by the
money made in the City; the artist looks for his patron to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span>
City; the working man, whatever his work, is paid out of the
City, so that the first function of the City is to feed and supply
all these millions. If at any time the trade of the City were
to decay, these suburbs would decay as well; if the decay
were gradual, they would slowly cease to spread, begin to
show empty houses and deserted streets; if the decay were
to mean ruin, the suburbs would themselves be speedily
deserted. Then would be seen a deserted city on a scale
never before equalled. Tadmor in the Wilderness would be
a mere little wheelbarrow full of stones compared with
suburban London given over to decay and wreck.</p>

<p>Two millions of people, most of whom belong to the
working class! The brain reels at thinking of this teeming
multitudinous life; these armies of men, women, and children
living in the slums and in the huge, unlovely barracks. The
very number makes it impossible to grasp the enormity of the
mass; the vastness of the population makes one feel as if
individual effort would be absolutely useless. In a sense it is
useless, because it can only touch one or two, and what are
they among so many? But in another sense, as I will
presently show, individual effort may produce consequences
both deep and widespread.</p>

<p>It seems, again, when one contemplates this mass of
humanity&mdash;this compact round ball of men and women, to
make which two millions have been brought together&mdash;as if
any one life was nothing, as if the life of any one out of the
heap&mdash;any girl, any lad&mdash;was wholly unimportant and trivial,
however that life were spent. That is not so: every heap is
made up of atoms; the influence of the individual is as great
in a densely populated place as in a village. One example
is precious&mdash;beyond all price&mdash;in a model dwelling-house of
Bermondsey as in the most retired community of rustics. It
is very easy to generalise from the mass: the dweller of the
slums stands before the mind's eye, beery, unwashed, in rags,
inarticulate, his brain filled with thoughts which may better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span>
be described as suspicions, desirous of nothing but of food,
drink, and warmth. That is what we think of him. It is
because we do not know him. Ask those who go down
among these people habitually, they will tell you of differences
and distinctions among them as among ourselves, of memories
of better things, of resignation rather than despair, and, at the
very worst, of traits of generosity and unselfishness worthy of
a clean cottage and the air of a village green. We must be
very careful how we form general conclusions about men and
women.</p>

wanting all the time what he thinks will make his life more
happy. For the riverside folk the wants are few, but they are
daily wants. With them, literally, it is a question of daily
bread. Happy are the people whose wants are more numerous
and their happiness more complex!</p>

<p>Let me terminate this chapter by a brief account of certain
work of a philanthropic kind which is characteristic of the
place and of the time. Many and various are the attempts
and the associations and the machinery for raising some of
these people and for keeping others from sliding down.
There are the parish clergy, of late years better organised
than at any previous time, more active, and more largely
assisted; they have planted evening schools and clubs, for
boys and girls. One must put the Church of England first, not
only because her clergy began the work of rescue, but also
because hers is still the larger part. There is, next, the indirect
work of the medical students of Guy's and St. Thomas's,
who go in and out among the worst courts, tolerated because
they come to doctor the sick, and do not ask disagreeable
questions about the children's school. There are, next,
places which aim at civilising by the presentation of things
civilised. For instance, there is a very pleasing institute in
Whitecross Street, where a garden, an open air band, a lecture
or concert hall, and a row of cottages beautiful to look upon
are provided as a standard to which the people may rise by
degrees. There are one or two Polytechnics for the lads, and,
lastly, there are the 'Settlements,' college settlements and
others. Let me briefly describe the work and aims of one of
these settlements. I have before me the last Report of the
Browning Settlement in Walworth. It is called the Browning
Settlement because its headquarters is the chapel in York
Street in which Robert Browning was christened.</p>

<span class="caption">The Entrance Gates to Guy&#39;s</span>
</div>

<p>As for their plan of work, perhaps the aims and methods
of a 'settlement' are not too well known for repetition. They
are not all the same, but the differences are slight. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">{325}</a></span>
directors of this settlement, for instance, desire to plant a
settlement house in every poor street; a house which shall
be inhabited by the workers, men or women, and shall serve
as a model for the other people in the street; example, in fact,
is relied upon as a potent influence. There is, or will be, a
large club house and coffee tavern for men and women, boys
and girls. Once a week there is a concert in the hall. The
members of the settlement take as large a part as possible in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">{326}</a></span>
the local government; they have laid out a burial-ground at
the back of their hall as a garden; they have a medical
mission which gives consultations free; some of them are poor
men's lawyers; they have introduced the University Extension
Lectures; they have founded thrift agencies; they hold Sunday
afternoons for the men; they have a maternity society;
they have a clothes store; they have an adult school. Classes
are held in hygiene, mathematics, and classics; there have
been Shakespeare readings, music, singing, country holidays,
summer camps, children's holidays; there is a boys' brigade;
there is musical drill; there are May Day and Harvest
Festivals; and there are, in addition, works of religion and
temperance which I have not enumerated above.</p>

<p>The keynote of all such work as this is, for the workers,
personal service; for the people, the influence of example, the
attraction of things which they understand at once to be a
great deal more pleasant than the bar and the tap-room; such
a variety of work and recreation as may drag all into the net
except the substratum of all, whom nothing can lift out of the
mire.</p>

<p>One or two things have yet to be learned as regards these
settlements. First, how large an area in a densely populated
part can be covered by a single settlement? Next, how many
young men can be found to carry on the work? For instance,
if the Browning Settlement can reach&mdash;of course it cannot&mdash;all
the people of Walworth, which is in the Parish of Newington,
and includes 120,000 people, there ought to be nine
other settlements in South London from Battersea to Greenwich,
both included. If we give 20,000 people for each
settlement, then there ought to be at least fifty settlements for
the millions of the working class. The Report does not
state how many residents there are, but gives a list of the
officers and managers of departments, from which it would
seem that about thirty are actively engaged from day to day.
So that fifteen hundred voluntary workers in all would be required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">{327}</a></span>
in order to cover this land of slums with an effective
string of settlements.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 399px;"><a name="A_Former_Entrance_to_St_Thomas" id="A_Former_Entrance_to_St_Thomas"></a>
<img src="images/illus_341.jpg" width="399" height="550" alt="A Former Entrance to St. Thomas&#39;s Hospital" title="" />
<span class="caption">A Former Entrance to St. Thomas&#39;s Hospital</span>
</div>

<p>There never was a time when more determined efforts
have been made for the elevation of the submerged, and there
never was a time when so many young men and young
women have been found ready to give the whole of their
time, or all their spare time, to the work. Whether they will
succeed in effecting a permanent improvement remains to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">{328}</a></span>
seen; whether the attraction of personal devotion which is now
passing over the minds of the young will continue and remain
with us has also to be proved. The directors of the Browning
Settlement meantime declare&mdash;I have no intention of
questioning the truth of their assertion&mdash;that they find already
among the people 'a quickening of spirit, shown in keener
intellectual interest, intenser civic ardour, warmer friendship,
and more avowed piety.' If such are the fruits of a settlement,
we cannot but desire for South London a chain of
settlements reaching from Battersea to Greenwich, both inclusive.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Since this was written several new Theatres have been built in South
London. I should therefore like to correct the passage on p. <a href="#Page_320">320</a> which states
that the Theatres are humble. Also I would acknowledge the existence of local
newspapers, and instead of saying that it has no public buildings I would say
only one or two old buildings.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">{329}</a></span></p>
